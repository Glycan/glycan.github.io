**SYLVANO BUSSOTI** The two of us wrote *Anti-Oedipus *together. Since each of us was several,  there was already quite a crowd. Here we have made use of everything that  came within range, what was closest as well as farthest away. We have  assigned clever pseudonyms to prevent recognition. Why have we kept our  own names? Out of habit, purely out of habit. To make ourselves unrecog-  nizable in turn. To render imperceptible, not ourselves, but what makes us  act, feel, and think. Also because it's nice to talk like everybody else, to say  the sun rises, when everybody knows it's only a manner of speaking. To  reach, not the point where one no longer says I, but the point where it is no  longer of any importance whether one says I. We are no longer ourselves.  Each will know his own. We have been aided, inspired, multiplied. A book has neither object nor subject; it is made of variously formed matters, and very different dates and speeds. To attribute the book to a  subject is to overlook this working of matters, and the exteriority of their  relations. It is to fabricate a beneficent God to explain geological move-  ments. In a book, as in all things, there are lines of articulation or  segmentarity, strata and territories; but also lines of flight, movements of  deterritorialization and destratification. Comparative rates of flow on **3**

4 D INTRODUCTION: RHIZOME these lines produce phenomena of relative slowness and viscosity, or, on the contrary, of acceleration and rupture. All this, lines and measurable speeds, constitutes an *assemblage. *A book is an assemblage of this kind, and as such is unattributable. It is a multiplicity—but we don't know yet what the multiple entails when it is no longer attributed, that is, after it has been elevated to the status of a substantive. One side of a machinic assem blage faces the strata, which doubtless make it a kind of organism, or signi fying totality, or determination attributable to a subject; it also has a side facing a *body without organs, *which is continually dismantling the organ ism, causing asignifying particles or pure intensities to pass or circulate, and attributing to itself subjects that it leaves with nothing more than a name as the trace of an intensity. What is the body without organs of a book? There are several, depending on the nature of the lines considered, their particular grade or density, and the possibility of their converging on a "plane of consistency" assuring their selection. Here, as elsewhere, the units of measure are what is essential: *quantify writing. *There is no differ ence between what a book talks about and how it is made. Therefore a book also has no object. As an assemblage, a book has only itself, in connection with other assemblages and in relation to other bodies without organs. We will never ask what a book means, as signified or signifier; we will not look for anything to understand in it. We will ask what it functions with, in con nection with what other things it does or does not transmit intensities, in which other multiplicities its own are inserted and metamorphosed, and with what bodies without organs it makes its own converge. A book exists only through the outside and on the outside. A book itself is a little machine; what is the relation (also measurable) of this literary machine to a war machine, love machine, revolutionary machine, etc.—and an *abstract  machine *that sweeps them along? We have been criticized for overquoting literary authors. But when one writes, the only question is which other machine the literary machine can be plugged into, must be plugged into in order to work. Kleist and a mad war machine, Kafka and a most extraordi nary bureaucratic machine . . . (What if one became animal or plant  *through *literature, which certainly does not mean literarily? Is it not first through the voice that one becomes animal?) Literature is an assemblage. It has nothing to do with ideology. There is no ideology and never has been. All we talk about are multiplicities, lines, strata and segmentarities, lines of flight and intensities, machinic assemblages and their various types, bodies without organs and their construction and selection, the plane of consistency, and in each case the units of measure. *Stratometers,  deleometers, BwO units of density, BwO units of convergence: *Not only do these constitute a quantification of writing, but they define writing as always the measure of something else. Writing has nothing to do with

I NTRODUCTION: RHIZOME □ 5 signifying. It has to do with surveying, mapping, even realms that are yet to come. A first type of book is the root-book. The tree is already the image of the world, or the root the image of the world-tree. This is the classical book, as noble, signifying, and subjective organic interiority (the strata of the book). The book imitates the world, as art imitates nature: by procedures specific to it that accomplish what nature cannot or can no longer do. The law of the book is the law of reflection, the One that becomes two. How could the law of the book reside in nature, when it is what presides over the very division between world and book, nature and art? One becomes two: whenever we encounter this formula, even stated strategically by Mao or understood in the most "dialectical" way possible, what we have before us is the most clas sical and well reflected, oldest, and weariest kind of thought. Nature doesn't work that way: in nature, roots are taproots with a more multiple, lateral, and circular system of ramification, rather than a dichotomous one. Thought lags behind nature. Even the book as a natural reality is a tap root, with its pivotal spine and surrounding leaves. But the book as a spiri tual reality, the Tree or Root as an image, endlessly develops the law of the One that becomes two, then of the two that become four. . . Binary logic is the spiritual reality of the root-tree. Even a discipline as "advanced" as lin guistics retains the root-tree as its fundamental image, and thus remains wedded to classical reflection (for example, Chomsky and his grammatical trees, which begin at a point S and proceed by dichotomy). This is as much as to say that this system of thought has never reached an understanding of multiplicity: in order to arrive at two following a spiritual method it must assume a strong principal unity. On the side of the object, it is no doubt pos sible, following the natural method, to go directly from One to three, four, or five, but only if there is a strong principal unity available, that of the piv otal taproot supporting the secondary roots. That doesn't get us very far. The binary logic of dichotomy has simply been replaced by biunivocal rela tionships between successive circles. The pivotal taproot provides no bet ter understanding of multiplicity than the dichotomous root. One operates in the object, the other in the subject. Binary logic and biunivocal relation ships still dominate psychoanalysis (the tree of delusion in the Freudian interpretation of Schreber's case), linguistics, structuralism, and even information science. The radicle-system, or fascicular root, is the second figure of the book, to which our modernity pays willing allegiance. This time, the principal root has aborted, or its tip has been destroyed; an immediate, indefinite multiplicity of secondary roots grafts onto it and undergoes a flourishing development. This time, natural reality is what aborts the principal root, but the root's unity subsists, as past or yet to come, as possible. We must ask

6 D INTRODUCTION: RHIZOME if reflexive, spiritual reality does not compensate for this state of things by demanding an even more comprehensive secret unity, or a more extensive totality. Take William Burroughs's cut-up method: the folding of one text onto another, which constitutes multiple and even adventitious roots (like a cutting), implies a supplementary dimension to that of the texts under consideration. In this supplementary dimension of folding, unity contin ues its spiritual labor. That is why the most resolutely fragmented work can also be presented as the Total Work or Magnum Opus. Most modern meth ods for making series proliferate or a multiplicity grow are perfectly valid in one direction, for example, a linear direction, whereas a unity of totalization asserts itself even more firmly in another, circular or cyclic, dimension. Whenever a multiplicity is taken up in a structure, its growth is offset by a reduction in its laws of combination. The abortionists of unity are indeed angel makers, *doctores angelici, *because they affirm a properly angelic and superior unity. Joyce's words, accurately described as having "multiple roots," shatter the linear unity of the word, even of language, only to posit a cyclic unity of the sentence, text, or knowledge. Nietzsche's aphorisms shatter the linear unity of knowledge, only to invoke the cyclic unity of the eternal return, present as the nonknown in thought. This is as much as to say that the fascicular system does not really break with dual ism, with the complementarity between a subject and an object, a natural reality and a spiritual reality: unity is consistently thwarted and obstructed in the object, while a new type of unity triumphs in the subject. The world has lost its pivot; the subject can no longer even dichotomize, but accedes to a higher unity, of ambivalence or overdetermination, in an always sup plementary dimension to that of its object. The world has become chaos, but the book remains the image of the world: radicle-chaosmos rather than root-cosmos. A strange mystification: a book all the more total for being fragmented. At any rate, what a vapid idea, the book as the image of the world. In truth, it is not enough to say, "Long live the multiple," difficult as it is to raise that cry. No typographical, lexical, or even syntactical clever ness is enough to make it heard. The multiple *must be made, *not by always adding a higher dimension, but rather in the simplest of ways, by dint of sobriety, with the number of dimensions one already has available— always *n *\- 1 (the only way the one belongs to the multiple: always sub tracted). Subtract the unique from the multiplicity to be constituted; write at *n *- 1 dimensions. A system of this kind could be called a rhizome. A rhi zome as subterranean stem is absolutely different from roots and radicles. Bulbs and tubers are rhizomes. Plants with roots or radicles may be rhizomorphic in other respects altogether: the question is whether plant life in its specificity is not entirely rhizomatic. Even some animals are, in their pack form. Rats are rhizomes. Burrows are too, in all of their func

0 INTRODUCTION: RHIZOME □ 7 tions of shelter, supply, movement, evasion, and breakout. The rhizome itself assumes very diverse forms, from ramified surface extension in all directions to concretion into bulbs and tubers. When rats swarm over each other. The rhizome includes the best and the worst: potato and couchgrass, or the weed. Animal and plant, couchgrass is crabgrass. We get the distinct feeling that we will convince no one unless we enumerate certain approxi mate characteristics of the rhizome. 1 and 2. Principles of connection and heterogeneity: any point of a rhi zome can be connected to anything other, and must be. This is very differ ent from the tree or root, which plots a point, fixes an order. The linguistic tree on the Chomsky model still begins at a point S and proceeds by dichot omy. On the contrary, not every trait in a rhizome is necessarily linked to a linguistic feature: semiotic chains of every nature are connected to very diverse modes of coding (biological, political, economic, etc.) that bring into play not only different regimes of signs but also states of things of dif fering status. *Collective assemblages of enunciation *function directly within *machinic assemblages; *it is not impossible to make a radical break between regimes of signs and their objects. Even when linguistics claims to confine itself to what is explicit and to make no presuppositions about lan guage, it is still in the sphere of a discourse implying particular modes of assemblage and types of social power. Chomsky's grammaticality, the cate gorical S symbol that dominates every sentence, is more fundamentally a marker of power than a syntactic marker: you will construct grammatically correct sentences, you will divide each statement into a noun phrase and a verb phrase (first dichotomy. . .). Our criticism of these linguistic models is not that they are too abstract but, on the contrary, that they are not abstract enough, that they do not reach the *abstract machine *that connects a language to the semantic and pragmatic contents of statements, to collec tive assemblages of enunciation, to a whole micropolitics of the social field. A rhizome ceaselessly establishes connections between semiotic chains, organizations of power, and circumstances relative to the arts, sci ences, and social struggles. A semiotic chain is like a tuber agglomerating very diverse acts, not only linguistic, but also perceptive, mimetic, gestural, and cognitive: there is no language in itself, nor are there any lin guistic universals, only a throng of dialects, patois, slangs, and specialized languages. There is no ideal speaker-listener, any more than there is a homogeneous linguistic community. Language is, in Weinreich's words, "an essentially heterogeneous reality." 1 There is no mother tongue, only a power takeover by a dominant language within a political multiplicity. Language stabilizes around a parish, a bishopric, a capital. It forms a bulb. It evolves by subterranean stems and flows, along river valleys or train tracks; it spreads like a patch of oil. 2 It is always possible to break a language

8 □ INTRODUCTION: RHIZOME down into internal structural elements, an undertaking not fundamentally different from a search for roots. There is always something genealogical about a tree. It is not a method for the people. A method of the rhizome type, on the contrary, can analyze language only by decentering it onto other dimensions and other registers. A language is never closed upon itself, except as a function of impotence. 3\. Principle of multiplicity: it is only when the multiple is effectively treated as a substantive, "multiplicity," that it ceases to have any relation to the One as subject or object, natural or spiritual reality, image and world. Multiplicities are rhizomatic, and expose arborescent pseudomulti-plicities for what they are. There is no unity to serve as a pivot in the object, or to divide in the subject. There is not even the unity to abort in the object or "return" in the subject. A multiplicity has neither subject nor object, only determinations, magnitudes, and dimensions that cannot increase in number without the multiplicity changing in nature (the laws of combination therefore increase in number as the multiplicity grows). Puppet strings, as a rhizome or multiplicity, are tied not to the supposed will of an artist or puppeteer but to a multiplicity of nerve fibers, which form another puppet in other dimensions connected to the first: "Call the strings or rods that move the puppet the weave. It might be objected that  *its multiplicity *resides in the person of the actor, who projects it into the text. Granted; but the actor's nerve fibers in turn form a weave. And they fall through the gray matter, the grid, into the undifferentiated... . The interplay approximates the pure activity of weavers attributed in myth to the Fates or Norns." 3 An assemblage is precisely this increase in the dimensions of a multiplicity that necessarily changes in nature as it expands its connections. There are no points or positions in a rhizome, such as those found in a structure, tree, or root. There are only lines. When Glenn Gould speeds up the performance of a piece, he is not just displaying virtuosity, he is transforming the musical points into lines, he is making the whole piece proliferate. The number is no longer a universal concept measuring elements according to their emplacement in a given dimension, but has itself become a multiplicity that varies according to the dimensions considered (the primacy of the domain over a complex of numbers attached to that domain). We do not have units *(unites) *of measure, only multiplicities or varieties of measurement. The notion of unity *{unite) *appears only when there is a power takeover in the multiplicity by the signifier or a corresponding subjectification proceeding: This is the case for a pivot-unity forming the basis for a set of biunivocal relationships between objective elements or points, or for the One that divides following the law of a binary logic of differentiation in the subject. Unity always operates in an empty dimension supplementary to that of the system considered (overcoding).

The point is that a rhizome or multiplicity never allows itself to be overcoded, never has available a supplementary dimension over and above its number of lines, that is, over and above the multiplicity of num bers attached to those lines. All multiplicities are flat, in the sense that they fill or occupy all of their dimensions: we will therefore speak *of a plane of  consistency *of multiplicities, even though the dimensions of this "plane" increase with the number of connections that are made on it. Multiplicities are defined by the outside: by the abstract line, the line of flight or deterritorialization according to which they change in nature and connect with other multiplicities. The plane of consistency (grid) is the outside of all multiplicities. The line of flight marks: the reality of a finite number of dimensions that the multiplicity effectively fills; the impossibility of a sup plementary dimension, unless the multiplicity is transformed by the line of flight; the possibility and necessity of flattening all of the multiplicities on a single plane of consistency or exteriority, regardless of their number of dimensions. The ideal for a book would be to lay everything out on a plane of exteriority of this kind, on a single page, the same sheet: lived events, his torical determinations, concepts, individuals, groups, social formations. Kleist invented a writing of this type, a broken chain of affects and variable speeds, with accelerations and transformations, always in a relation with the outside. Open rings. His texts, therefore, are opposed in every way to the classical or romantic book constituted by the interiority of a substance or subject. The war machine-book against the State apparatus-book. *Flat  multiplicities of n dimensions *are asignifying and asubjective. They are designated by indefinite articles, or rather by partitives *{some *couchgrass,  *some *of a rhizome . ..). 4\. Principle of asignifying rupture: against the oversignifying breaks separating structures or cutting across a single structure. A rhizome may be broken, shattered at a given spot, but it will start up again on one of its old lines, or on new lines. You can never get rid of ants because they form an animal rhizome that can rebound time and again after most of it has been destroyed. Every rhizome contains lines of segmentarity according to which it is stratified, territorialized, organized, signified, attributed, etc., as well as lines of deterritorialization down which it constantly flees. There is a rupture in the rhizome whenever segmentary lines explode into a line of flight, but the line of flight is part of the rhizome. These lines always tie back to one another. That is why one can never posit a dualism or a dichot omy, even in the rudimentary form of the good and the bad. You may make a rupture, draw a line of flight, yet there is still a danger that you will reencounter organizations that restratify everything, formations that restore power to a signifier, attributions that reconstitute a subject— anything you like, from Oedipal resurgences to fascist concretions.

10 □ INTRODUCTION: RHIZOME and individuals contain microfascisms just waiting to crystallize. Yes, couchgrass is also a rhizome. Good and bad are only the products of an active and temporary selection, which must be renewed. How could movements of deterritorialization and processes of reterri-torialization not be relative, always connected, caught up in one another? The orchid deterritorializes by forming an image, a tracing of a wasp; but the wasp reterritorializes on that image. The wasp is nevertheless deterritorialized, becoming a piece in the orchid's reproductive apparatus. But it reterritorializes the orchid by transporting its pollen. Wasp and orchid, as heterogeneous elements, form a rhizome. It could be said that the orchid imitates the wasp, reproducing its image in a signifying fashion (mimesis, mimicry, lure, etc.). But this is true only on the level of the strata—a parallelism between two strata such that a plant organization on one imitates an animal organization on the other. At the same time, something else entirely is going on: not imitation at all but a capture of code, surplus value of code, an increase in valence, a veritable becoming, a becoming-wasp of the orchid and a becoming-orchid of the wasp. Each of these becomings brings about the deterritorialization of one term and the reterritorialization of the other; the two becomings interlink and form relays in a circulation of intensities pushing the deterritorialization ever further. There is neither imitation nor resemblance, only an exploding of two heterogeneous series on the line of flight composed by a common rhizome that can no longer be attributed to or subjugated by anything signifying. Rimy Chauvin expresses it well: "the  *aparallel evolution *of two beings that have absolutely nothing to do with each other." 4 More generally, evolutionary schemas may be forced to abandon the old model of the tree and descent. Under certain conditions, a virus can connect to germ cells and transmit itself as the cellular gene of a complex species; moreover, it can take flight, move into the cells of an entirely different species, but not without bringing with it "genetic information" from the first host (for example, Benveniste and Todaro's current research on a type C virus, with its double connection to baboon DNA and the DNA of certain kinds of domestic cats). Evolutionary schemas would no longer follow models of arborescent descent going from the least to the most differentiated, but instead a rhizome operating immediately in the heterogeneous and jumping from one already differentiated line to another. 5 Once again, there is *aparallel evolution, *of the baboon and the cat; it is obvious that they are not models or copies of each other (a becoming-baboon in the cat does not mean that the cat "plays" baboon). We form a rhizome with our viruses, or rather our viruses cause us to form a rhizome with other animals. As Francois Jacob says, transfers of genetic material by viruses or through other procedures, fusions of cells originating in different species, have results analogous to

I NTRODUCTION: RHIZOME □ 11 those of "the abominable couplings dear to antiquity and the Middle Ages." 6 Transversal communications between different lines scramble the genealogical trees. Always look for the molecular, or even submolecular, particle with which we are allied. We evolve and die more from our polymorphous and rhizomatic flus than from hereditary diseases, or diseases that have their own line of descent. The rhizome is an anti-genealogy. The same applies to the book and the world: contrary to a deeply rooted belief, the book is not an image of the world. It forms a rhizome with the world, there is an aparallel evolution of the book and the world; the book assures the deterritorialization of the world, but the world effects a reterri-torialization of the book, which in turn deterritorializes itself in the world (if it is capable, if it can). Mimicry is a very bad concept, since it relies on binary logic to describe phenomena of an entirely different nature. The crocodile does not reproduce a tree trunk, any more than the chameleon reproduces the colors of its surroundings. The Pink Panther imitates nothing, it reproduces nothing, it paints the world its color, pink on pink; this is its becoming-world, carried out in such a way that it becomes imperceptible itself, asignifying, makes its rupture, its own line of flight, follows its "aparallel evolution" through to the end. The wisdom of the plants: even when they have roots, there is always an outside where they form a rhizome with something else—with the wind, an animal, human beings (and there is also an aspect under which animals themselves form rhizomes, as do people, etc.). "Drunkenness as a triumphant irruption of the plant in us." Always follow the rhizome by rupture; lengthen, prolong, and relay the line of flight; make it vary, until you have produced the most abstract and tortuous of lines of *n *dimensions and broken directions. Conjugate deterritorialized flows. Follow the plants: you start by delimiting a first line consisting of circles of convergence around successive singularities; then you see whether inside that line new circles of convergence establish themselves, with new points located outside the limits and in other directions. Write, form a rhizome, increase your territory by deterritorialization, extend the line of flight to the point where it becomes an abstract machine covering the entire plane of consistency. "Go first to your old plant and watch carefully the watercourse made by the rain. By now the rain must have carried the seeds far away. Watch the crevices made by the runoff, and from them determine the direction of the flow. Then find the plant that is growing at the farthest point from your plant. All the devil's weed plants that are growing in between are yours. Later... you can extend the size of your territory by following the watercourse from each point along the way." 7 Music has always sent out lines of flight, like so many "transformational multiplicities," even overturning the very codes that structure or

1 2 □ INTRODUCTION: RHIZOME arborify it; that is why musical form, right down to its ruptures and prolif erations, is comparable to a weed, a rhizome. 8 5 and 6. Principle of cartography and decalcomania: a rhizome is not amenable to any structural or generative model. It is a stranger to any idea of genetic axis or deep structure. A genetic axis is like an objective pivotal unity upon which successive stages are organized; a deep structure is more like a base sequence that can be broken down into immediate constituents, while the unity of the product passes into another, transformational and subjective, dimension. This does not constitute a departure from the repre sentative model of the tree, or root—pivotal taproot or fascicles (for exam ple, Chomsky's "tree" is associated with a base sequence and represents the process of its own generation in terms of binary logic). A variation on the oldest form of thought. It is our view that genetic axis and profound struc ture are above all infinitely reproducible principles of *tracing. *All of tree logic is a logic of tracing and reproduction. In linguistics as in psychoanaly sis, its object is an unconscious that is itself representative, crystallized into codified complexes, laid out along a genetic axis and distributed within a syntagmatic structure. Its goal is to describe a de facto state, to maintain balance in intersubjective relations, or to explore an unconscious that is already there from the start, lurking in the dark recesses of memory and language. It consists of tracing, on the basis of an overcoding structure or supporting axis, something that comes ready-made. The tree articulates and hierarchizes tracings; tracings are like the leaves of a tree. The rhizome is altogether different, a *map and not a tracing. *Make a map, not a tracing. The orchid does not reproduce the tracing of the wasp; it forms a map with the wasp, in a rhizome. What distinguishes the map from the tracing is that it is entirely oriented toward an experimentation in contact with the real. The map does not reproduce an unconscious closed in upon itself; it constructs the unconscious. It fosters connections between fields, the removal of blockages on bodies without organs, the maximum opening of bodies without organs onto a plane of consistency. It is itself a part of the rhizome. The map is open and connectable in all of its dimen sions; it is detachable, reversible, susceptible to constant modification. It can be torn, reversed, adapted to any kind of mounting, reworked by an individual, group, or social formation. It can be drawn on a wall, conceived of as a work of art, constructed as a political action or as a meditation. Per haps one of the most important characteristics of the rhizome is that it always has multiple entryways; in this sense, the burrow is an animal rhi zome, and sometimes maintains a clear distinction between the line of flight as passageway and storage or living strata (cf. the muskrat). A map has multiple entryways, as opposed to the tracing, which always comes back "to the same." The map has to do with performance, whereas the trac

I NTRODUCTION: RHIZOME □ 13 ing always involves an alleged "competence." Unlike psychoanalysis, psy choanalytic competence (which confines every desire and statement to a genetic axis or overcoding structure, and makes infinite, monotonous trac ings of the stages on that axis or the constituents of that structure), schizoanalysis rejects any idea of pretraced destiny, whatever name is given to it—divine, anagogic, historical, economic, structural, hereditary, or syntagmatic. (It is obvious that Melanie Klein has no understanding of the cartography of one of her child patients, Little Richard, and is content to make ready-made tracings—Oedipus, the good daddy and the bad daddy, the bad mommy and the good mommy—while the child makes a desperate attempt to carry out a performance that the psychoanalyst totally misconstrues.) 9 Drives and part-objects are neither stages on a genetic axis nor positions in a deep structure; they are political options for problems, they are entryways and exits, impasses the child lives out politi cally, in other words, with all the force of his or her desire. Have we not, however, reverted to a simple dualism by contrasting maps to tracings, as good and bad sides? Is it not of the essence of the map to be traceable? Is it not of the essence of the rhizome to intersect roots and sometimes merge with them? Does not a map contain phenomena of redundancy that are already like tracings of its own? Does not a multipli city have strata upon which unifications and totalizations, massifications, mimetic mechanisms, signifying power takeovers, and subjective attribu tions take root? Do not even lines of flight, due to their eventual diver gence, reproduce the very formations their function it was to dismantle or outflank? But the opposite is also true. It is a question of method: *the trac-  ing should always be put back on the map. *This operation and the previous one are not at all symmetrical. For it is inaccurate to say that a tracing reproduces the map. It is instead like a photograph or X ray that begins by selecting or isolating, by artificial means such as colorations or other restrictive procedures, what it intends to reproduce. The imitator always creates the model, and attracts it. The tracing has already translated the map into an image; it has already transformed the rhizome into roots and radicles. It has organized, stabilized, neutralized the multiplicities accord ing to the axes of signifiance and subjectification belonging to it. It has gen erated, structurahzed the rhizome, and when it thinks it is reproducing something else it is in fact only reproducing itself. That is why the tracing is so dangerous. It injects redundancies and propagates them. What the trac ing reproduces of the map or rhizome are only the impasses, blockages, incipient taproots, or points of structuration. Take a look at psychoanalysis and linguistics: all the former has ever made are tracings or photos of the unconscious, and the latter of language, with all the betrayals that implies (it's not surprising that psychoanalysis tied its fate to that of linguistics).

1 4 □ INTRODUCTION: RHIZOME Look at what happened to Little Hans already, an example of child psycho analysis at its purest: they kept on BREAKING HIS RHIZOME and BLOTCHING HIS MAP, setting it straight for him, blocking his every way out, until he began to desire his own shame and guilt, until they had rooted shame and guilt in him, PHOBIA (they barred him from the rhizome of the building, then from the rhizome of the street, they rooted him in his parents' bed, they radicled him to his own body, they fixated him on Professor Freud). Freud explicitly takes Little Hans's cartography into account, but always and only in order to project it back onto the family photo. And look what Melanie Klein did to Little Richard's geopolitical maps: she developed photos from them, made tracings of them. Strike the pose or follow the axis, genetic stage or structural destiny—one way or the other, your rhi zome will be broken. You will be allowed to live and speak, but only after every outlet has been obstructed. Once a rhizome has been obstructed, arborified, it's all over, no desire stirs; for it is always by rhizome that desire moves and produces. Whenever desire climbs a tree, internal repercus sions trip it up and it falls to its death; the rhizome, on the other hand, acts on desire by external, productive outgrowths. That is why it is so important to try the other, reverse but nonsym metrical, operation. Plug the tracings back into the map, connect the roots or trees back up with a rhizome. In the case of Little Hans, studying the unconscious would be to show how he tries to build a rhizome, with the family house but also with the line of flight of the building, the street, etc.; how these lines are blocked, how the child is made to take root in the family, be photographed under the father, be traced onto the mother's bed; then how Professor Freud's intervention assures a power takeover by the signifier, a subjectification of affects; how the only escape route left to the child is a becoming-animal perceived as shameful and guilty (the becoming-horse of Little Hans, a truly political option). But these impasses must always be resituated on the map, thereby opening them up to possible lines of flight. The same applies to the group map: show at what point in the rhizome there form phenomena of massification, bureaucracy, leadership, fascization, etc., which lines nevertheless survive, if only underground, continuing to make rhizome in the shadows. Deligny's method: map the gestures and movements of an autistic child, combine several maps for the same child, for several different children. 10 If it is true that it is of the essence of the map or rhizome to have multiple entryways, then it is plausi ble that one could even enter them through tracings or the root-tree, assum ing the necessary precautions are taken (once again, one must avoid any Manichaean dualism). For example, one will often be forced to take dead ends, to work with signifying powers and subjective affections, to find a foothold in formations that are Oedipal or paranoid or even worse,

I NTRODUCTION: RHIZOME D 15 rigidified territorialities that open the way for other transformational operations. It is even possible for psychoanalysis to serve as a foothold, in spite of itself. In other cases, on the contrary, one will bolster oneself directly on a line of flight enabling one to blow apart strata, cut roots, and make new connections. Thus, there are very diverse map-tracing, rhizome-root assemblages, with variable coefficients of deterritorialization. There exist tree or root structures in rhizomes; conversely, a tree branch or root division may begin to burgeon into a rhizome. The coordinates are determined not by theoretical analyses implying universals but by a pragmatics composing multiplicities or aggregates of intensities. A new rhizome may form in the heart of a tree, the hollow of a root, the crook of a branch. Or else it is a microscopic element of the root-tree, a radicle, that gets rhizome production going. Accounting and bureaucracy proceed by tracings: they can begin to burgeon nonetheless, throwing out rhizome stems, as in a Kafka novel. An intensive trait starts working for itself, a hallucinatory perception, synesthesia, perverse mutation, or play of images shakes loose, challenging the hegemony of the signifier. In the case of the child, gestural, mimetic, ludic, and other semiotic systems regain their freedom and extricate themselves from the "tracing," that is, from the dominant competence of the teacher's language—a microscopic event upsets the local balance of power. Similarly, generative trees constructed according to Chomsky's syntagmatic model can open up in all directions, and in turn form a rhi zome. 11 To be rhizomorphous is to produce stems and filaments that seem to be roots, or better yet connect with them by penetrating the trunk, but put them to strange new uses. We're tired of trees. We should stop believing in trees, roots, and radicles. They've made us suffer too much. All of arborescent culture is founded on them, from biology to linguistics. Noth ing is beautiful or loving or political aside from underground stems and aerial roots, adventitious growths and rhizomes. Amsterdam, a city entirely without roots, a rhizome-city with its stem-canals, where utility connects with the greatest folly in relation to a commercial war machine. Thought is not arborescent, and the brain is not a rooted or ramified matter. What are wrongly called "dendrites" do not assure the connection of neurons in a continuous fabric. The discontinuity between cells, the role of the axons, the functioning of the synapses, the existence of synaptic microfissures, the leap each message makes across these fissures, make the brain a multiplicity immersed in its plane of consistency or neuroglia, a whole uncertain, probabilistic system ("the uncertain nervous system"). Many people have a tree growing in their heads, but the brain itself is much more a grass than a tree. "The axon and the dendrite twist around each other like bindweed around brambles, with synapses at each of the thorns." 12 The same goes for memory. Neurologists and psychophysiolo

16 D INTRODUCTION: RHIZOME gists distinguish between long-term memory and short-term memory (on the order of a minute). The difference between them is not simply quantita tive: short-term memory is of the rhizome or diagram type, and long-term memory is arborescent and centralized (imprint, engram, tracing, or pho tograph). Short-term memory is in no way subject to a law of contiguity or immediacy to its object; it can act at a distance, come or return a long time after, but always under conditions of discontinuity, rupture, and multipli city. Furthermore, the difference between the two kinds of memory is not that of two temporal modes of apprehending the same thing; they do not grasp the same thing, memory, or idea. The splendor of the short-term Idea: one writes using short-term memory, and thus short-term ideas, even if one reads or rereads using long-term memory of long-term concepts. Short-term memory includes forgetting as a process; it merges not with the instant but instead with the nervous, temporal, and collective rhizome. Long-term memory (family, race, society, or civilization) traces and trans lates, but what it translates continues to act in it, from a distance, offbeat, in an "untimely" way, not instantaneously. The tree and root inspire a sad image of thought that is forever imitating the multiple on the basis of a centered or segmented higher unity. If we con sider the set, branches-roots, the trunk plays the role of *opposed segment * for one of the subsets running from bottom to top: this kind of segment is a "link dipole," in contrast to the "unit dipoles" formed by spokes radiating from a single center. 13 Even if the links themselves proliferate, as in the radicle system, one can never get beyond the One-Two, and fake multiplici ties. Regenerations, reproductions, returns, hydras, and medusas do not get us any further. Arborescent systems are hierarchical systems with cen ters of signifiance and subjectification, central automata like organized memories. In the corresponding models, an element only receives infor mation from a higher unit, and only receives a subjective affection along preestablished paths. This is evident in current problems in information science and computer science, which still cling to the oldest modes of thought in that they grant all power to a memory or central organ. Pierre Rosenstiehl and Jean Petitot, in a fine article denouncing "the imagery of command trees" (centered systems or hierarchical structures), note that "accepting the primacy of hierarchical structures amounts to giving arborescent structures privileged status.... The arborescent form admits of topological explanation.... In a hierarchical system, an individual has only one active neighbor, his or her hierarchical superior.... The channels of transmission are preestablished: the arborescent system preexists the individual, who is integrated into it at an allotted place" (signifiance and subjectification). The authors point out that even when one thinks one has reached a multiplicity, it may be a false one—of what we call the radicle

An example is the famous *friendship theorem: *"If any two given individuals in a society have precisely one mutual friend, then there exists an individual who is the friend of all the others." (Rosenstiehl and Petitot ask who that mutual friend is. Who is "the universal friend in this society of couples: the master, the confessor, the doctor? These ideas are curiously far removed from the initial axioms." Who is this friend of humankind? Is it the .pMosopher as he appears in classical thought, even if he is an aborted unity that makes itself felt only through its absence or subjectivity, saying all the while, I know nothing, I am nothing?) Thus the authors speak of dictatorship theo rems. Such is indeed the principle of roots-trees, or their outcome: the radicle solution, the structure of Power. 14 To these centered systems, the authors contrast acentered systems, finite networks of automata in which communication runs from any neigh bor to any other, the stems or channels do not preexist, and all individuals are interchangeable, defined only by their *state *at a given moment—such that the local operations are coordinated and the final, global result syn chronized without a central agency. Transduction of intensive states replaces topology, and "the graph regulating the circulation of information is in a way the opposite of the hierarchical graph.. . . There is no reason for the graph to be a tree" (we have been calling this kind of graph a map). The problem of the war machine, or the firing squad: is a general necessary for *n * individuals to manage to fire in unison? The solution without a General is to be found in an acentered multiplicity possessing a finite number of states with signals to indicate corresponding speeds, from a war rhizome or guerrilla logic point of view, without any tracing, without any copying of a central order. The authors even demonstrate that this kind of machinic multiplicity, assemblage, or society rejects any centralizing or unifying automaton as an "asocial intrusion." 15 Under these conditions, *n *is in fact always *n *- 1\. Rosenstiehl and Petitot emphasize that the opposition, centered-acentered, is valid less as a designation for things than as a mode of calculation applied to things. Trees may correspond to the rhizome, or they may burgeon into a rhizome. It is true that the same thing is generally susceptible to both modes of calculation or both types of regulation, but not without undergoing a change in state. Take psychoanalysis as an exam ple again: it subjects the unconscious to arborescent structures, hierarchi cal graphs, recapitulatory memories, central organs, the phallus, the phallus-tree—not only in its theory but also in its practice of calculation and treatment. Psychoanalysis cannot change its method in this regard: it bases its own dictatorial power upon a dictatorial conception of the uncon scious. Psychoanalysis's margin of maneuverability is therefore very

18 □ INTRODUCTION: RHIZOME limited. In both psychoanalysis and its object, there is always a general, always a leader (General Freud). Schizoanalysis, on the other hand, treats the unconscious as an acentered system, in other words, as a machinic net work of finite automata (a rhizome), and thus arrives at an entirely differ ent state of the unconscious. These same remarks apply to linguistics; Rosenstiehl and Petitot are right to bring up the possibility of an "acentered organization of a society of words." For both statements and desires, the issue is never to reduce the unconscious or to interpret it or to make it signify according to a tree model. The issue is to *produce the uncon-  scious, *and with it new statements, different desires: the rhizome is pre cisely this production of the unconscious. It is odd how the tree has dominated Western reality and all of Western thought, from botany to biology and anatomy, but also gnosiology, theol ogy, ontology, all of philosophy . ..: the root-foundation, *Grund, racine,  fondement. *The West has a special relation to the forest, and deforestation; the fields carved from the forest are populated with seed plants produced by cultivation based on species lineages of the arborescent type; animal raising, carried out on fallow fields, selects lineages forming an entire ani mal arborescence. The East presents a different figure: a relation to the steppe and the garden (or in some cases, the desert and the oasis), rather than forest and field; cultivation of tubers by fragmentation of the individ ual; a casting aside or bracketing of animal raising, which is confined to closed spaces or pushed out onto the steppes of the nomads. The West: agri culture based on a chosen lineage containing a large number of variable individuals. The East: horticulture based on a small number of individuals derived from a wide range of "clones." Does not the East, Oceania in par ticular, offer something like a rhizomatic model opposed in every respect to the Western model of the tree? Andre Haudricourt even sees this as the basis for the opposition between the moralities or philosophies of tran scendence dear to the West and the immanent ones of the East: the God who sows and reaps, as opposed to the God who replants and unearths (replanting of offshoots versus sowing of seeds). 16 Transcendence: a specif ically European disease. Neither is music the same, the music of the earth is different, as is sexuality: seed plants, even those with two sexes in the same plant, subjugate sexuality to the reproductive model; the rhizome, on the other hand, is a liberation of sexuality not only from reproduction but also from genitality. Here in the West, the tree has implanted itself in our bod ies, rigidifying and stratifying even the sexes. We have lost the rhizome, or the grass. Henry Miller: "China is the weed in the human cabbage patch. ... The weed is the Nemesis of human endeavor.... Of all the imaginary existences we attribute to plant, beast and star the weed leads the most sat isfactory life of all. True, the weed produces no lilies, no battleships, no Ser

This condition is usually referred to by historians as the Dark Age. Grass is the only way out.... The weed exists only to fill the waste spaces left by cultivated areas. *It grows between, * among other things. The lily is beautiful, the cabbage is provender, the poppy is maddening—but the weed is rank growth ...: it points a moral." 17 Which China is Miller talking about? The old China, the new, an imaginary one, or yet another located on a shifting map? America is a special case. Of course it is not immune from domination by trees or the search for roots. This is evident even in the literature, in the quest for a national identity and even for a European ancestry or genealogy (Kerouac going off in search of his ancestors). Nevertheless, everything important that has happened or is happening takes the route of the Ameri can rhizome: the beatniks, the underground, bands and gangs, successive lateral offshoots in immediate connection with an outside. American books are different from European books, even when the American sets off in pursuit of trees. The conception of the book is different. *Leaves of Grass. * And directions in America are different: the search for arborescence and the return to the Old World occur in the East. But there is the rhizomatic West, with its Indians without ancestry, its ever-receding limit, its shifting and displaced frontiers. There is a whole American "map" in the West, where even the trees form rhizomes. America reversed the directions: it put its Orient in the West, as if it were precisely in America that the earth came full circle; its West is the edge of the East. 18 (India is not the intermediary between the Occident and the Orient, as Haudricourt believed: America is the pivot point and mechanism of reversal.) The American singer Patti Smith sings the bible of the American dentist: Don't go for the root, follow the canal... Are there not also two kinds of bureaucracy, or even three (or still more)? Western bureaucracy: its agrarian, cadastral origins; roots and fields; trees and their role as frontiers; the great census of William the Conqueror; feu dalism; the policies of the kings of France; making property the basis of the State; negotiating land through warfare, litigation, and marriages. The kings of France chose the lily because it is a plant with deep roots that clings to slopes. Is bureaucracy the same in the Orient? Of course it is all too easy to depict an Orient of rhizomes and immanence; yet it is true that in the Orient the State does not act following a schema of arborescence corre sponding to preestablished, arborified, and rooted classes; its bureaucracy is one of channels, for example, the much-discussed case of hydraulic power with "weak property," in which the State engenders channeled and channelizing classes (cf. the aspects of Wittfogel's work that have not been refuted). 19 The despot acts as a river, not as a fountainhead, which is still a

2 0 □ INTRODUCTION: RHIZOME point, a tree-point or root; he flows with the current rather than sitting under a tree; Buddha's tree itself becomes a rhizome; Mao's river and Louis's tree. Has not America acted as an intermediary here as well? For it proceeds both by internal exterminations and liquidations (not only the Indians but also the farmers, etc.), and by successive waves of immigration from the outside. The flow of capital produces an immense channel, a quantification of power with immediate "quanta," where each person profits from the passage of the money flow in his or her own way (hence the reality-myth of the poor man who strikes it rich and then falls into poverty again): in America everything comes together, tree and channel, root and rhizome. There is no universal capitalism, there is no capitalism in itself; capitalism is at the crossroads of all kinds of formations, it is neocapitalism by nature. It invents its eastern face and western face, and reshapes them both—all for the worst. At the same time, we are on the wrong track with all these geographical distributions. An impasse. So much the better. If it is a question of showing that rhizomes also have their own, even more rigid, despotism and hierar chy, then fine and good: for there is no dualism, no ontological dualism between here and there, no axiological dualism between good and bad, no blend or American synthesis. There are knots of arborescence in rhizomes, and rhizomatic offshoots in roots. Moreover, there are despotic formations of immanence and channelization specific to rhizomes, just as there are anarchic deformations in the transcendent system of trees, aerial roots, and subterranean stems. The important point is that the root-tree and canal-rhizome are not two opposed models: the first operates as a tran scendent model and tracing, even if it engenders its own escapes; the sec ond operates as an immanent process that overturns the model and outlines a map, even if it constitutes its own hierarchies, even if it gives rise to a despotic channel. It is not a question of this or that place on earth, or of a given moment in history, still less of this or that category of thought. It is a question of a model that is perpetually in construction or collapsing, and of a process that is perpetually prolonging itself, breaking off and starting up again. No, this is not a new or different dualism. The problem of writing: in order to designate something exactly, anexact expressions are utterly unavoidable. Not at all because it is a necessary step, or because one can only advance by approximations: anexactitude is in no way an approxima tion; on the contrary, it is the exact passage of that which is under way. We invoke one dualism only in order to challenge another. We employ a dual ism of models only in order to arrive at a process that challenges all models. Each time, mental correctives are necessary to undo the dualisms we had no wish to construct but through which we pass. Arrive at the magic formula we all seek— PLURALISM = MONISM —via all the dualisms that are

I NTRODUCTION: RHIZOME □ 21 the enemy, an entirely necessary enemy, the furniture we are forever rearranging. Let us summarize the principal characteristics of a rhizome: unlike trees or their roots, the rhizome connects any point to any other point, and its traits are not necessarily linked to traits of the same nature; it brings into play very different regimes of signs, and even nonsign states. The rhizome is reducible neither to the One nor the multiple. It is not the One that becomes Two or even directly three, four, five, etc. It is not a multiple derived from the One, or to which One is added *(n + *1). It is composed not of units but of dimensions, or rather directions in motion. It has neither beginning nor end, but always a middle *(milieu) *from which it grows and which it overspills. It constitutes linear multiplicities with *n *dimensions having neither subject nor object, which can be laid out on a plane of con sistency, and from which the One is always subtracted *(n *\- 1). When a mul tiplicity of this kind changes dimension, it necessarily changes in nature as well, undergoes a metamorphosis. Unlike a structure, which is defined by a set of points and positions, with binary relations between the points and biunivocal relationships between the positions, the rhizome is made only of lines: lines of segmentarity and stratification as its dimensions, and the line of flight or deterritorialization as the maximum dimension after which the multiplicity undergoes metamorphosis, changes in nature. These lines, or lineaments, should not be confused with lineages of the arborescent type, which are merely localizable linkages between points and positions. Unlike the tree, the rhizome is not the object of reproduction: neither external reproduction as image-tree nor internal reproduction as tree-structure. The rhizome is an antigenealogy. It is a short-term memory, or antimemory. The rhizome operates by variation, expansion, conquest, capture, offshoots. Unlike the graphic arts, drawing, or photography, unlike tracings, the rhizome pertains to a map that must be produced, con structed, a map that is always detachable, connectable, reversible, modifiable, and has multiple entryways and exits and its own lines of flight. It is tracings that must be put on the map, not the opposite. In con trast to centered (even polycentric) systems with hierarchical modes of communication and preestablished paths, the rhizome is an acentered, nonhierarchical, nonsignifying system without a General and without an organizing memory or central automaton, defined solely by a circulation of states. What is at question in the rhizome is a relation to sexuality—but also to the animal, the vegetal, the world, politics, the book, things natural and artificial—that is totally different from the arborescent relation: all manner of "becomings." A plateau is always in the middle, not at the beginning or the end. A rhi zome is made of plateaus. Gregory Bateson uses the word "plateau" to

2 2 □ INTRODUCTION: RHIZOME designate something very special: a continuous, self-vibrating region of intensities whose development avoids any orientation toward a culmina tion point or external end. Bateson cites Balinese culture as an example: mother-child sexual games, and even quarrels among men, undergo this bizarre intensive stabilization. "Some sort of continuing plateau of inten sity is substituted for [sexual] climax," war, or a culmination point. It is a regrettable characteristic of the Western mind to relate expressions and actions to exterior or transcendent ends, instead of evaluating them on a plane of consistency on the basis of their intrinsic value. 20 For example, a book composed of chapters has culmination and termination points. What takes place in a book composed instead of plateaus that communicate with one another across microfissures, as in a brain? We call a "plateau" any multiplicity connected to other multiplicities by superficial underground stems in such a way as to form or extend a rhizome. We are writing this book as a rhizome. It is composed of plateaus. We have given it a circular form, but only for laughs. Each morning we would wake up, and each of us would ask himself what plateau he was going to tackle, writing five lines here, ten there. We had hallucinatory experiences, we watched lines leave one plateau and proceed to another like columns of tiny ants. We made cir cles of convergence. Each plateau can be read starting anywhere and can be related to any other plateau. To attain the multiple, one must have a method that effectively constructs it; no typographical cleverness, no lexi cal agility, no blending or creation of words, no syntactical boldness, can substitute for it. In fact, these are more often than not merely mimetic pro cedures used to disseminate or disperse a unity that is retained in a differ ent dimension for an image-book. Technonarcissism. Typographical, lexical, or syntactic creations are necessary only when they no longer belong to the form of expression of a hidden unity, becoming themselves dimensions of the multiplicity under consideration; we only know of rare successes in this. 21 We ourselves were unable to do it. We just used words that in turn function for us as plateaus. RHIZOMATICS = SCHIZOANALYSIS = STRATOA NALYSIS = PRAGMATICS = MICROPOLITICS . These words are con cepts, but concepts are lines, which is to say, number systems attached to a particular dimension of the multiplicities (strata, molecular chains, lines of flight or rupture, circles of convergence, etc.). Nowhere do we claim for our concepts the title of a science. We are no more familiar with scientif-icity than we are with ideology; all we know are assemblages. And the only assemblages are machinic assemblages of desire and collective assemblages of enunciation. No signifiance, no subjectification: writing to the «th power (all individuated enunciation remains trapped within the dominant significations, all signifying desire is associated with dominated subjects). An assemblage, in its multiplicity, necessarily acts on semiotic flows,

I NTRODUCTION: RHIZOME □ 23 material flows, and social flows simultaneously (independently of any recapitulation that may be made of it in a scientific or theoretical corpus). There is no longer a tripartite division between a field of reality (the world) and a field of representation (the book) and a field of subjectivity (the author). Rather, an assemblage establishes connections between certain multiplicities drawn from each of these orders, so that a book has no sequel nor the world as its object nor one or several authors as its subject. In short, we think that one cannot write sufficiently in the name of an outside. The outside has no image, no signification, no subjectivity. The book as assem blage with the outside, against the book as image of the world. A rhizome-book, not a dichotomous, pivotal, or fascicular book. Never send down roots, or plant them, however difficult it may be to avoid reverting to the old procedures. "Those things which occur to me, occur to me not from the root up but rather only from somewhere about their middle. Let someone then attempt to seize them, let someone attempt to seize a blade of grass and hold fast to it when it begins to grow only from the middle." 22 Why is this so difficult? The question is directly one of perceptual semiotics. It's not easy to see things in the middle, rather than looking down on them from above or up at them from below, or from left to right or right to left: try it, you'll see that everything changes. It's not easy to see the grass in things and in words (similarly, Nietzsche said that an aphorism had to be "ruminated"; never is a plateau separable from the cows that populate it, which are also the clouds in the sky). History is always written from the sedentary point of view and in the name of a unitary State apparatus, at least a possible one, even when the topic is nomads. What is lacking is a Nomadology, the opposite of a history. There are rare successes in this also, for example, on the subject of the Children's Crusades: Marcel Schwob's book multiplies narratives like so many plateaus with variable numbers of dimensions. Then there is Andrzejewski's book, *Les portes du paradis *(The gates of paradise), com posed of a single uninterrupted sentence; a flow of children; a flow of walk ing with pauses, straggling, and forward rushes; the semiotic flow of the confessions of all the children who go up to the old monk at the head of the procession to make their declarations; a flow of desire and sexuality, each child having left out of love and more or less directly led by the dark posthu mous pederastic desire of the count of Vendome; all this with circles of con vergence. What is important is not whether the flows are "One or multiple"—we're past that point: there is a collective assemblage of enun ciation, a machinic assemblage of desire, one inside the other and both plugged into an immense outside that is a multiplicity in any case. A more recent example is Armand Farrachi's book on the Fourth Crusade, *La dis-  location, *in which the sentences space themselves out and disperse, or else

2 4 □ INTRODUCTION: RHIZOME jostle together and coexist, and in which the letters, the typography begin to dance as the crusade grows more delirious. 23 These are models of nomadic and rhizomatic writing. Writing weds a war machine and lines of flight, abandoning the strata, segmentarities, sedentarity, the State apparatus. But why is a model still necessary? Aren't these books still "images" of the Crusades? Don't they still retain a unity, in Schwob's case a pivotal unity, in Farrachi's an aborted unity, and in the most beautiful example, *Les portes du paradis, *the unity of the funereal count? Is there a need for a more profound nomadism than that of the Crusades, a nomadism of true nomads, or of those who no longer even move or imitate anything? The nomadism of those who only assemble *(agencent). *How can the book find an adequate outside with which to assemble in heterogeneity, rather than a world to reproduce? The cultural book is necessarily a tracing: already a tracing of itself, a tracing of the previous book by the same author, a tracing of other books however different they may be, an endless tracing of established concepts and words, a tracing of the world present, past, and future. Even the anticultural book may still be burdened by too heavy a cul tural load: but it will use it actively, for forgetting instead of remembering, for underdevelopment instead of progress toward development, in nomadism rather than sedentarity, to make a map instead of a tracing. RHIZOMATICS = POP ANALYSIS, even if the people have other things to do besides read it, even if the blocks of academic culture or pseudoscien-tificity in it are still too painful or ponderous. For science would go completely mad if left to its own devices. Look at mathematics: it's not a science, it's a monster slang, it's nomadic. Even in the realm of theory, especially in the realm of theory, any precarious and pragmatic framework is better than tracing concepts, with their breaks and progress changing nothing. Imperceptible rupture, not signifying break. The nomads invented a war machine in opposition to the State apparatus. History has never comprehended nomadism, the book has never comprehended the outside. The State as the model for the book and for thought has a long history: logos, the philosopher-king, the transcendence of the Idea, the interiority of the concept, the republic of minds, the court of reason, the functionaries of thought, man as legislator and subject. The State's pretension to be a world order, and to root man. The war machine's relation to an outside is not another "model"; it is an assemblage that makes thought itself nomadic, and the book a working part in every mobile machine, a stem for a rhizome (Kleist and Kafka against Goethe). Write to the *nth *power, the *n *\- 1 power, write with slogans: Make rhi zomes, not roots, never plant! Don't sow, grow offshoots! Don't be one or multiple, be multiplicities! Run lines, never plot a point! Speed turns the point into a line! 24 Be quick, even when standing still! Line of chance, line

0 INTRODUCTION: RHIZOME □ 25 of hips, line of flight. Don't bring out the General in you! Don't have just ideas, just have an idea (Godard). Have short-term ideas. Make maps, not photos or drawings. Be the Pink Panther and your loves will be like the wasp and the orchid, the cat and the baboon. As they say about old man river: He don't plant 'tatos Don't plant cotton Them that plants them is soon forgotten But old man river he just keeps rollin' along A rhizome has no beginning or end; it is always in the middle, between things, interbeing, *intermezzo. *The tree is filiation, but the rhizome is alli ance, uniquely alliance. The tree imposes the verb "to be," but the fabric of the rhizome is the conjunction, "and. . . and.. . and. . ." This conjunction carries enough force to shake and uproot the verb "to be." Where are you going? Where are you coming from? What are you heading for? These are totally useless questions. Making a clean slate, starting or beginning again from ground zero, seeking a beginning or a foundation—all imply a false conception of voyage and movement (a conception that is methodical, ped agogical, initiatory, symbolic...). But Kleist, Lenz, and Biichner have another way of traveling and moving: proceeding from the middle, through the middle, coming and going rather than starting and finishing. 25 Ameri can literature, and already English literature, manifest this rhizomatic direction to an even greater extent; they know how to move between things, establish a logic of the AND , overthrow ontology, do away with foundations, nullify endings and beginnings. They know how to practice pragmatics. The middle is by no means an average; on the contrary, it is where things pick up speed. *Between *things does not designate a localizable relation going from one thing to the other and back again, but a perpendicular direction, a transversal movement that sweeps one *and *the other away, a stream without beginning or end that undermines its banks and picks up speed in the middle.

2\. 1914: One or Several Wolves? Field of Tracks, or Wolf Line That day, the Wolf-Man rose from the couch particularly tired. He knew  that Freud had a genius for brushing up against the truth and passing it by,  then filling the void with associations. He knew that Freud knew nothing  about wolves, or anuses for that matter. The only thing Freud understood  was what a dog is, and a dog's tail. It wasn't enough. It wouldn't be enough.  The Wolf-Man knew that Freud would soon declare him cured, but that it  was not at all the case and his treatment would continue for all eternity  under Brunswick, Lacan, Leclaire. Finally, he knew that he was in the pro-  cess of acquiring a veritable proper name, the Wolf-Man, a name more  properly his than his own, since it attained the highest degree of singularity 26

1 914: ONE OR SEVERAL WOLVES? □ 27 in the instantaneous apprehension of a generic multiplicity: wolves. He knew that this new and true proper name would be disfigured and mis spelled, retranscribed as a patronymic. Freud, for his part, would go on to write some extraordinary pages. Entirely practical pages: his article of 1915 on "The Unconscious," which deals with the difference between neurosis and psychosis. Freud says that hysterics or obsessives are people capable of making a global comparison between a sock and a vagina, a scar and castration, etc. Doubtless, it is at one and the same time that they apprehend the object globally and perceive it as lost. Yet it would never occur to a neurotic to grasp the skin erotically as a multiplicity of pores, little spots, little scars or black holes, or to grasp the sock erotically as a multiplicity of stitches. The psychotic can: "we should expect the multiplicity of these little cavities to prevent him from using them as substitutes for the female genital." 1 Comparing a sock to a vagina is OK, it's done all the time, but you'd have to be insane to compare a pure aggregate of stitches to a field of vaginas: that's what Freud says. This represents an important clinical discovery: a whole difference in style between neurosis and psychosis. For example, Salvador Dali, in attempt ing to reproduce his delusions, may go on at length about THE rhinoceros horn; he has not for all of that left neurotic discourse behind. But when he starts comparing goosebumps to a field of tiny rhinoceros horns, we get the feeling that the atmosphere has changed and that we are now in the pres ence of madness. Is it still a question of a comparison at all? It is, rather, a pure multiplicity that changes elements, or *becomes. *On the micrological level, the little bumps "become" horns, and the horns, little penises. No sooner does Freud discover the greatest art of the unconscious, this art of molecular multiplicities, than we find him tirelessly at work bringing back molar unities, reverting to his familiar themes of *the *father, *the *penis,  *the *vagina, Castration with a capital *C... *(On the verge of discovering a rhizome, Freud always returns to mere roots.) The reductive procedure of the 1915 article is quite interesting: he says that the comparisons and iden tifications of the neurotic are guided by representations of things, whereas all the psychotic has left are representations of words (for example, the word "hole"). "What has dictated the substitution is not the resemblance between the things denoted but the sameness of the words used to express them" (p. 201). Thus, when there is no unity in the thing, there is at least unity and identity in the word. It will be noted that names are taken in their  *extensive *usage, in other words, function as common nouns ensuring the unification of an aggregate they subsume. The proper name can be nothing more than an extreme case of the common noun, containing its already domesticated multiplicity within itself and linking it to a being or object posited as unique. This jeopardizes, on the side of words and things both,

2 8 □ 1914: ONE OR SEVERAL WOLVES? the relation of the proper name as an *intensity *to the multiplicity it instan-  taneously apprehends. For Freud, when the thing splinters and loses its  identity, the word is still there to restore that identity or invent a new one.  Freud counted on the word to reestablish a unity no longer found in things.  Are we not witnessing the first stirrings of a subsequent adventure, that of  *the *Signifier, the devious despotic agency that substitutes itself for  asignifying proper names and replaces multiplicities with the dismal unity  of an object declared lost? We're not far from wolves. For the Wolf-Man, in his second so-called psychotic episode, kept constant watch over the variations or changing  path of the little holes or scars on the skin of his nose. During the first epi-  sode, which Freud declares neurotic, he recounted a dream he had about  six or seven wolves in a tree, and drew five. Who is ignorant of the fact that  wolves travel in packs? Only Freud. Every child knows it. Not Freud. With  false scruples he asks, How are we to explain the fact that there are five, six,  or seven wolves in this dream? He has decided that this is neurosis, so he  uses the other reductive procedure: free association on the level of the rep-  resentation of things, rather than verbal subsumption on the level of the  representation of words. The result is the same, since it is always a question  of bringing back the unity or identity of the person or allegedly lost object.  The wolves will have to be purged of their multiplicity. This operation is  accomplished by associating the dream with the tale, "The Wolf and the  Seven Kid-Goats" (only six of which get eaten). We witness Freud's reduc-  tive glee; we literally see multiplicity leave the wolves to take the shape of  goats that have absolutely nothing to do with the story. Seven wolves that  are only kid-goats. Six wolves: the seventh goat (the Wolf-Man himself) is  hiding in the clock. Five wolves: he may have seen his parents make love at  five o'clock, and the roman numeral V is associated with the erotic spread-  ing of a woman's legs. Three wolves: the parents may have made love three  times. Two wolves: the first coupling the child may have seen was the two  parents *more ferarum, *or perhaps even two dogs. One wolf: the wolf is the  father, as we all knew from the start. Zero wolves: he lost his tail, he is not  just a castrater but also castrated. Who is Freud trying to fool? The wolves  never had a chance to get away and save their pack: it was already decided  from the very beginning that animals could serve only to represent coitus  between parents, or, conversely, be represented by coitus between parents.  Freud obviously knows nothing about the fascination exerted by wolves  and the meaning of their silent call, the call to become-wolf. Wolves watch,  intently watch, the dreaming child; it is so much more reassuring to tell  oneself that the dream produced a reversal and that it is really the child who  sees dogs or parents in the act of making love. Freud only knows the

1 914: ONE OR SEVERAL WOLVES? D 29 Oedipalized wolf or dog, the castrated-castrating daddy-wolf, the dog in the kennel, the analyst's bow-wow. Franny is listening to a program on wolves. I say to her, Would you like to be a wolf? She answers haughtily, How stupid, you can't be one wolf, you're always eight or nine, six or seven. Not six or seven wolves all by yourself all at once, but one wolf among others, with five or six others. In becoming-wolf, the important thing is the position of the mass, and above all the position of the subject itself in relation to the pack or wolf-multiplicity: how the subject joins or does not join the pack, how far away it stays, how it does or does not hold to the multiplicity. To soften the harshness of her response, Franny recounts a dream: "There is a desert. Again, it wouldn't make any sense to say that I am *in *the desert. It's a panoramic vision of the desert, and it's not a tragic or uninhabited desert. It's only a desert because of its ocher color and its blazing, shadowless sun. There is a teeming crowd in it, a swarm of bees, a rumble of soccer players, oragroup of Tuareg. *lam on the edge of the crowd, at the periphery;  but I belong to it, I am attached to it by one of my extremities, a hand or  foot. *I know that the periphery is the only place I can be, that I would die if I let myself be drawn into the center of the fray, but just as certainly if I let go of the crowd. This is not an easy position to stay in, it is even very difficult to hold, for these beings are in constant motion and their movements are unpredictable and follow no rhythm. They swirl, go north, then suddenly east; none of the individuals in the crowd remains in the same place in relation to the others. So I too am in perpetual motion; all this demands a high level of tension, but it gives me a feeling of violent, almost vertiginous, happiness." A very good schizo dream. To be fully a part of the crowd and at the same time completely outside it, removed from it: to be on the edge, to take a walk like Virginia Woolf (never again will I say, *"I am this, I am thai").* *1* Problems of peopling in the unconscious: all that passes through the pores of the schizo, the veins of the drug addict, swarming, teeming, fer ment, intensities, races and tribes. This tale of white skin prickling with bumps and pustules, and of dwarfish black heads emerging from pores gri macing and abominable, needing to be shaved off every morning—is it a tale by Jean Ray, who knew how to bring terror to phenomena of micromultiplicity? And how about the "Lilliputian hallucinations" on ether? One schizo, two schizos, three: "There are babies growing in my every pore"—"With me, it's not in the pores, it's in my veins, little iron rods growing in my veins"—"I don't want them to give me any shots, except with camphorated alcohol. Otherwise breasts grow in my every pore." Freud tried to approach crowd phenomena from the point of view of the unconscious, but he did not see clearly, he did not see that the uncon scious itself was fundamentally a crowd. He was myopic and hard of

3 0 D 1914: ONE OR SEVERAL WOLVES? hearing; he mistook crowds for a single person. Schizos, on the other hand, have sharp eyes and ears. They don't mistake the buzz and shove of the crowd for daddy's voice. Once Jung had a dream about bones and skulls. A bone or a skull is never alone. Bones are a multiplicity. But Freud wants the dream to signify the death of *someone. *"Jung was surprised and pointed out that there were several skulls, not just one. Yet Freud still. . ." 3 A multiplicity of pores, or blackheads, of little scars or stitches. Breasts, babies, and rods. A multiplicity of bees, soccer players, or Tuareg. A multi plicity of wolves or jackals ... All of these things are irreducible but bring us to a certain status of the formations of the unconscious. Let us try to define the factors involved: first, something plays the role of the full body—the body without organs. In the preceding dream it was the desert. In the Wolf-Man's dream it is the denuded tree upon which the wolves are perched. It is also the skin as envelope or ring, and the sock as reversible surface. It can be a house or part of a house, any number of things, any thing. Whenever someone makes love, really makes love, that person con stitutes a body without organs, alone and with the other person or people. A body without organs is not an empty body stripped of organs, but a body upon which that which serves as organs (wolves, wolf eyes, wolf jaws?) is distributed according to crowd phenomena, in Brownian motion, in the form of molecular multiplicities. The desert is populous. Thus the body without organs is opposed less to organs as such than to the organization of the organs insofar as it composes an organism. The body without organs is not a dead body but a living body all the more alive and teeming once it has blown apart the organism and its organization. Lice hopping on the beach. Skin colonies. The full body without organs is a body populated by multi plicities. The problem of the unconscious has most certainly nothing to do with generation but rather peopling, population. It is an affair of world wide population on the full body of the earth, not organic familial genera tion. "I love to invent peoples, tribes, racial origins ... I return from my tribes. As of today, I am the adoptive son of fifteen tribes, no more, no less. And they in turn are my adopted tribes, for I love each of them more than if I had been born into it." People say, After all, schizophrenics have a mother and a father, don't they? Sorry, no, none as such. They only have a desert with tribes inhabiting it, a full body clinging with multiplicities. This brings us to the second factor, the nature of these multiplicities and their elements. RHIZOME. One of the essential characteristics of the dream of multiplicity is that each element ceaselessly varies and alters its distance in relation to the others. On the Wolf-Man's nose, the elements, deter mined as pores in the skin, little scars in the pores, little ruts in the scar tis sue, ceaselessly dance, grow, and diminish. These variable distances are not extensive quantities divisible by each other; rather, each is indivisible,

1 914: ONE OR SEVERAL WOLVES? □ 31 or "relatively indivisible," in other words, they are not divisible below or above a certain threshold, they cannot increase or diminish *without their  elements changing in nature. *A swarm of bees: here they come as a rumble of soccer players in striped jerseys, or a band of Tuareg. Or: the wolf clan doubles up with a swarm of bees against the gang of Deulhs, under the direction of Mowgli, who runs on the edge (yes, Kipling understood the call of the wolves, their libidinal meaning, better than Freud; and in the Wolf-Man's case the story about wolves is followed by one about wasps and butterflies, we go from wolves to wasps). What is the significance of these indivisible distances that are ceaselessly transformed, and cannot be divided or transformed without their elements changing in nature each time? Is it not the intensive character of this kind of multiplicity's elements and the relations between them? Exactly like a speed or a temperature, which is not composed of other speeds and temperatures but rather is enveloped in or envelops others, each of which marks a change in nature. The metrical principle of these multiplicities is not to be found in a homo geneous milieu but resides elsewhere, in forces at work within them, in physical phenomena inhabiting them, precisely in the libido, which consti tutes them from within, and in constituting them necessarily divides into distinct qualitative and variable flows. Freud himself recognizes the multi plicity of libidinal "currents" that coexist in the Wolf-Man. That makes it all the more surprising that he treats the multiplicities of the unconscious the way he does. For him, there will always be a reduction to the One: the little scars, the little holes, become subdivisions of the great scar or supreme hole named castration; the wolves become substitutes for a single Father who turns up everywhere, or wherever they put him. (As Ruth Mack Brunswick says, Let's go all the way, the wolves are *"all *the fathers and doc tors" in the world; but the Wolf-Man thinks, "You trying to tell me my ass isn't a wolf?") What should have been done is the opposite, all of this should be under stood in intensity: the Wolf is the pack, in other words, the multiplicity instantaneously apprehended as such insofar as it approaches or moves away from zero, each distance being nondecomposable. Zero is the body without organs of the Wolf-Man. If the unconscious knows nothing of negation, it is because there is nothing negative in the unconscious, only indefinite moves toward and away from zero, which does not at all express lack but rather the positivity of the full body as support and prop ("for an afflux is necessary simply to signify the absence of intensity"). The wolves designate an intensity, a band of intensity, a threshold of intensity on the Wolf-Man's body without organs. A dentist told the Wolf-Man that he "would soon lose all his teeth because of the violence of his bite"—and that his gums were pocked with pustules and little holes. 4 Jaw as high intensity,

3 2 □ 1914: ONE OR SEVERAL WOLVES? teeth as low intensity, and pustular gums as approach to zero. The wolf, as the instantaneous apprehension of a multiplicity in a given region, is not a representative, a substitute, but an *I feel. *I feel myself becoming a wolf, one wolf among others, on the edge of the pack. A cry of anguish, the only one Freud hears: Help me not become wolf (or the opposite, Help me not fail in this becoming). It is not a question of representation: don't think for a min ute that it has to do with believing oneself a wolf, representing oneself as a wolf. The wolf, wolves, are intensities, speeds, temperatures, nondecom-posable variable distances. A swarming, a wolfing. Who could ever believe that the anal machine bears no relation to the wolf machine, or that the two are only linked by an Oedipal apparatus, by the all-too-human figure of the Father? For in the end the anus also expresses an intensity, in this case the approach to zero of a distance that cannot be decomposed without its elements changing in nature. *Afield of anuses, just like a pack of  wolves. *Does not the child, on the periphery, hold onto the wolves by his anus? The jaw descends to the anus. Hold onto those wolves by your jaw and your anus. The jaw is not a wolf jaw, it's not that simple; jaw and wolf form a multiplicity that is transformed into eye and wolf, anus and wolf, as a function of other distances, at other speeds, with other multiplicities, between thresholds. Lines of flight or of deterritorialization, becoming-wolf, becoming-inhuman, deterritorialized intensities: that is what multiplicity is. To become wolf or to become hole is to deterritorialize oneself following distinct but entangled lines. A hole is no more negative than a wolf. Castration, lack, substitution: a tale told by an overconscious idiot who has no understanding of multiplicities as formations of the unconscious. A wolf is a hole, they are both particles of the unconscious, nothing but particles, productions of particles, particulate paths, as elements of molecular multiplicities. It is not even sufficient to say that intense and moving particles pass through holes; a hole is just as much a particle as what passes through it. Physicists say that holes are not the absence of particles but particles traveling faster than the speed of light. Flying anuses, speeding vaginas, there is no castration. Let us return to the story *of multiplicity, *for the creation of this substan tive marks a very important moment. It was created precisely in order to escape the abstract opposition between the multiple and the one, to escape dialectics, to succeed in conceiving the multiple in the pure state, to cease treating it as a numerical fragment of a lost Unity or Totality or as the organic element of a Unity or Totality yet to come, and instead distinguish between different types of multiplicity. Thus we find in the work of the mathematician and physicist Riemann a distinction between discreet mul tiplicities and continuous multiplicities (the metrical principle of the sec ond kind of multiplicity resides solely in forces at work within them). Then

1 914: ONE OR SEVERAL WOLVES? D 33 in Meinong and Russell we find a distinction between multiplicities of magnitude or divisibility, which are extensive, and multiplicities of dis tance, which are closer to the intensive. And in Bergson there is a distinc tion between numerical or extended multiplicities and qualitative or durational multiplicities. We are doing approximately the same thing when we distinguish between arborescent multiplicities and rhizomatic multiplicities. Between macro- and micromultiplicities. On the one hand, multiplicities that are extensive, divisible, and molar; unifiable, total-izable, organizable; conscious or preconscious—and on the other hand, libidinal, unconscious, molecular, intensive multiplicities composed of particles that do not divide without changing in nature, and distances that do not vary without entering another multiplicity and that constantly construct and dismantle themselves in the course of their communications, as they cross over into each other at, beyond, or before a certain threshold. The elements of this second kind of multiplicity are particles; their relations are distances; their movements are Brownian; their quantities are intensities, differences in intensity. This only provides the logical foundation. Elias Canetti distinguishes between two types of multiplicity that are sometimes opposed but at other times interpenetrate: mass ("crowd") multiplicities and pack multiplici ties. Among the characteristics of a mass, in Canetti's sense, we should note large quantity, divisibility and equality of the members, concentration, sociability of the aggregate as a whole, one-way hierarchy, organization of territoriality or territorialization, and emission of signs. Among the char acteristics of a pack are small or restricted numbers, dispersion, nonde-composable variable distances, qualitative metamorphoses, inequalities as remainders or crossings, impossibility of a fixed totalization or hierar-chization, a Brownian variability in directions, lines of deterritorial-ization, and projection of particles. 5 Doubtless, there is no more equality or any less hierarchy in packs than in masses, but they are of a different kind. The leader of the pack or the band plays move by move, must wager everything every hand, whereas the group or mass leader consolidates or capitalizes on past gains. The pack, even on its own turf, is constituted by a line of flight or of deterritorialization that is a component part of it, and to which it accredits a high positive value, whereas masses only integrate these lines in order to segment them, obstruct them, ascribe them a negative sign. Canetti notes that in a pack each member is alone even in the company of others (for example, wolves on the hunt); each takes care of himself at the same time as participating in the band. "In the changing constellation of the pack, in its dances and expeditions, he will again and again find himself at its edge. He may be in the center, and then, immediately afterwards, at the edge again; at the edge and then back in the center. When

As opposed to the paranoid position of the mass subject, with all the identifications of the individual with the group, the group with the leader, and the leader with the group; be securely embedded in the mass, get close to the center, never be at the edge except in the line of duty. Why assume (as does Konrad Lorenz, for example) that bands and their type of companionship represent a more rudimentary evo lutionary state than group societies or societies of conjugality? Not only do there exist bands of humans, but there are particularly refined examples: "high-society life" differs from "sociality" in that it is closer to the pack. Social persons have a certain envious and erroneous image of the high-society person because they are ignorant of high-society positions and hierarchies, the relations of force, the very particular ambitions and projects. High-society relations are never coextensive with social relations, they do not coincide. Even "mannerisms" (all bands have them) are specific to micromultiplicities and distinct from social manners or customs. There is no question, however, of establishing a dualist opposition between the two types of multiplicities, molecular machines and molar machines', that would be no better than the dualism between the One and the multiple. There are only multiplicities of multiplicities forming a single  *assemblage, *operating in the same *assemblage: *packs in masses and masses in packs. Trees have rhizome lines, and the rhizome points of arbor-escence. How could mad particles be produced with anything but a gigantic cyclotron? How could lines of deterritorialization be assignable outside of circuits of territoriality? Where else but in wide expanses, and in major upheavals in those expanses, could a tiny rivulet of new intensity suddenly start to flow? What do you not have to do in order to produce a new sound? Becoming-animal, becoming-molecular, becoming-inhuman, each involves a molar extension, a human hyperconcentration, or prepares the way for them. In Kafka, it is impossible to separate the erection of a great paranoid bureaucratic machine from the installation of little schizo machines of becoming-dog or becoming-beetle. In the case of the Wolf-Man, it is impossible to separate the becoming-wolf of his dream from the military and religious organization of his obsessions. A military man does a wolf; a military man does a dog. There are not two multiplicities or two machines; one and the same machinic assemblage produces and distributes the whole, in other words, the set of statements corresponding to the "complex." What does psychoanalysis have to say about all of this? Oedipus, nothing but Oedipus, because it hears nothing and listens to nobody. It flattens everything, masses and packs, molecular and molar machines,

1 914: ONE OR SEVERAL WOLVES? □ 35 multiplicities of every variety. Take the Wolf-Man's second dream during his so-called psychotic episode: in the street, a wall with a closed door, to the left an empty dresser; in front of the dresser, the patient, and a big woman with a little scar who seems to want to skirt around the wall; behind the wall, wolves, rushing for the door. Even Brunswick can't go wrong: although she recognizes herself in the big woman, she does see that this time the wolves are Bolsheviks, the revolutionary mass that had emptied the dresser and confiscated the Wolf-Man's fortune. *The wolves, in a  metastable state, have gone over to a large-scale social machin*e But psycho analysis has nothing to say about all of these points—except what Freud already said: it all leads back to daddy (what do you know, he was one of the leaders of the liberal party in Russia, but that's hardly important; all that needs to be said is that the revolution "assuaged the patient's feelings of guilt"). You'd think that the investments and counterinvestments of the libido had nothing to do with mass disturbances, pack movements, collec tive signs, and particles of desire. Thus it does not suffice to attribute molar multiplicities and mass machines to the preconscious, reserving another kind of machine or multi plicity for the unconscious. For it is the assemblage of both of these that is the province of the unconscious, the way in which the former condition the latter, and the latter prepare the way for the former, or elude them or return to them: the libido suffuses everything. Keep everything in sight at the same time—that a social machine or an organized mass has a molecular unconscious that marks not only its tendency to decompose but also the current components of its very operation and organization; that any indi vidual caught up in a mass has his/her own pack unconscious, which does not necessarily resemble the packs of the mass to which that individual belongs; that an individual or mass will live out in its unconscious the masses and packs of another mass or another individual. What does it mean to love somebody? It is always to seize that person in a mass, extract him or her from a group, however small, in which he or she participates, whether it be through the family only or through something else; then to find that person's own packs, the multiplicities he or she encloses within himself or herself which may be of an entirely different nature. To join them to mine, to make them penetrate mine, and for me to penetrate the other person's. Heavenly nuptials, multiplicities of multiplicities. Every love is an exercise in depersonalization on a body without organs yet to be formed, and it is at the highest point of this depersonalization that some one can be *named, *receives his or her family name or first name, acquires the most intense discernibility in the instantaneous apprehension of the multiplicities belonging to him or her, and to which he or she belongs.

We each go through so many bodies in each other. Albertine is slowly extracted from a group of girls with its own number, organization, code, and hierarchy; and not only is this group or restricted mass suffused by an unconscious, but Albertine has her own multiplicities that the narrator, once he has isolated her, discovers on her body and in her lies—until the end of their love returns her to the indiscernible. Above all, it should not be thought that it suffices to distinguish the masses and exterior groups someone belongs to or participates in from the internal aggregates that person envelops in himself or herself. The distinction to be made is not at all between exterior and interior, which are always relative, changing, and reversible, but between different types of multiplicities that coexist, interpenetrate, and change places— machines, cogs, motors, and elements that are set in motion at a given moment, forming an assemblage productive of statements: "I love you" (or whatever). For Kafka, Felice is inseparable from a certain social machine, and, as a representative of the firm that manufactures them, from parlograph machines; how could she not belong to that organization in the eyes of Kafka, a man fascinated by commerce and bureaucracy? But at the same time, Felice's teeth, her big carnivorous teeth, send her racing down other lines, into the molecular multiplicities of a becoming-dog, a becoming-jackal . .. Felice is inseparable from the sign of the modern social machines belonging to her, from those belonging to Kafka (not the same ones), and from the particles, the little molecular machines, the whole strange becoming or journey Kafka will make and have her make through his perverse writing apparatus. There are no individual statements, only statement-producing ma-chinic assemblages. We say that the assemblage is fundamentally libidinal and unconscious. It is the unconscious in person. For the moment, we will note that assemblages have elements (or multiplicities) of several kinds: human, social, and technical machines, organized molar machines; molecular machines with their particles of becoming-inhuman; Oedipal apparatuses *(yes, of course there are Oedipal statements, many of them); * and counter-Oedipal apparatuses, variable in aspect and functioning. We will go into it later. We can no longer even speak of distinct machines, only of types of interpenetrating multiplicities that at any given moment form a single machinic assemblage, the faceless figure of the libido. Each of us is caught up in an assemblage of this kind, and we reproduce its statements when we think we are speaking in our own name; or rather we speak in our own name when we produce its statement. And what bizarre statements they are; truly, the talk of lunatics. We mentioned Kafka, but we could just

1 914: ONE OR SEVERAL WOLVES? □ 37 as well have said the Wolf-Man: a religious-military machine that Freud attributes to obsessional neurosis; an anal pack machine, an anal be coming-wolf or -wasp or -butterfly machine, which Freud attributes to the hysteric character; an Oedipal apparatus, which Freud considers the sole motor, the immobile motor that must be found everywhere; and a counter-Oedipal apparatus—incest with the sister, schizo-incest, or love with "people of inferior station"; and anality, homosexuality?—all that Freud sees only as Oedipal substitutes, regressions, and derivatives. In truth, Freud sees nothing and understands nothing. He has no idea what a libidinal assemblage is, with all the machineries it brings into play, all the multiple loves. Of course, there are Oedipal statements. For example, Kafka's story, "Jackals and Arabs," is easy to read in that way: you can always do it, you can't lose, it works every time, even if you understand nothing. The Arabs are clearly associated with the father and the jackals with the mother; between the two, there is a whole story of castration represented by the rusty scissors. But it so happens that the Arabs are an extensive, armed, organized mass stretching across the entire desert; and the jackals are an intense pack forever launching into the desert following lines of flight or deterritorialization ("they are madmen, veritable madmen"); between the two, at the edge, the Man of the North, the jackal-man. And aren't those big scissors the Arab sign that guides or releases jackal-particles, both to accel erate their mad race by detaching them from the mass and to bring them back to the mass, to tame them and whip them, to bring them around? Dead camel: Oedipal food apparatus. Counter-Oedipal carrion apparatus: kill animals to eat, or eat to clean up carrion. The jackals formulate the problem well: it is not that of castration but of "cleanliness" *(proprete, *also "ownness"), the test of desert-desire. Which will prevail, mass territoriality or pack deterritorialization? The libido suffuses the entire desert, the body without organs on which the drama is played out. There are no individual statements, there never are. Every statement is the product of a machinic assemblage, in other words, of collective agents of enunciation (take "collective agents" to mean not peoples or societies but multiplicities). The proper name *(nom propre) *does not designate an individual: it is on the contrary when the individual opens up to the multi plicities pervading him or her, at the outcome of the most severe operation of depersonalization, that he or she acquires his or her true proper name. The proper name is the instantaneous apprehension of a multiplicity. The proper name is the subject of a pure infinitive comprehended as such in a field of intensity. What Proust said about the first name: when I said Gilberte's name, I had the impression that I was holding her entire body naked in my mouth. The Wolf-Man, a true proper name, an intimate first

3 8 □ 1914: ONE OR SEVERAL WOLVES? name linked to the becomings, infinitives, and intensities of a multiplied and depersonalized individual. What does psychoanalysis know about multiplication? The desert hour when the dromedary becomes a thousand dromedaries snickering in the sky. The evening hour when a thousand holes appear on the surface of the earth. Castration! Castration! cries the psychoanalytic scarecrow, who never saw more than a hole, a father or a dog where wolves are, a domesticated individual where there are wild mul tiplicities. We are not just criticizing psychoanalysis for having selected Oedipal statements exclusively. For such statements are to a certain extent part of a machinic assemblage, for which they could serve as correctional indexes, as in a calculation of errors. We are criticizing psychoanalysis for having used Oedipal enunciation to make patients believe they would pro duce individual, personal statements, and would finally speak in their own name. The trap was set from the start: never will the Wolf-Man speak. Talk as he might about wolves, howl as he might like a wolf, Freud does not even listen; he glances at his dog and answers, "It's daddy." For as long as that lasts, Freud calls it neurosis; when it cracks, it's psychosis. The Wolf-Man will receive the psychoanalytic medal of honor for services rendered to the cause, and even disabled veterans' benefits. He could have spoken in his own name only if the machinic assemblage that was producing particular statements in him had been brought to light. But there is no question of that in psychoanalysis: at the very moment the subject is persuaded that he or she will be uttering the most individual of statements, he or she is deprived of all basis for enunciation. Silence people, prevent them from speaking, and above all, when they do speak, pretend they haven't said a thing: the famous psychoanalytic neutrality. The Wolf-Man keeps howling: Six wolves! Seven wolves! Freud says, How's that? Goats, you say? How inter esting. Take away the goats and all you have left is a wolf, so it's your father ... That is why the Wolf-Man feels so fatigued: he's left lying there with all his wolves in his throat, all those little holes on his nose, and all those libidi-nal values on his body without organs. The war will come, the wolves will become Bolsheviks, and the Wolf-Man will remain suffocated by all he had to say. All we will be told is that he became well behaved, polite, and resigned again, "honest and scrupulous." In short, cured. He gets back by pointing out that psychoanalysis lacks a truly zoological vision: "Nothing can be more valuable for a young person than the love of nature and a comprehension of the natural sciences, in particular zoology." 7

4 0 □ 10,000 B.C.: THE GEOLOGY OF MORALS The same Professor Challenger who made the Earth scream with his pain machine, as described by Arthur Conan Doyle, gave a lecture after mixing several textbooks on geology and biology in a fashion befitting his simian disposition. He explained that the Earth—the Deterritorialized, the Glacial, the giant Molecule—is a body without organs. This body without organs is permeated by unformed, unstable matters, by flows in all direc tions, by free intensities or nomadic singularities, by mad or transitory par ticles. That, however, was not the question at hand. For there simultane ously occurs upon the earth a very important, inevitable phenomenon that is beneficial in many respects and unfortunate in many others: stratifica tion. Strata are Layers, Belts. They consist of giving form to matters, of imprisoning intensities or locking singularities into systems of resonance and redundancy, of producing upon the body of the earth molecules large and small and organizing them into molar aggregates. Strata are acts of capture, they are like "black holes" or occlusions striving to seize whatever comes within their reach. 1 They operate by coding and territorialization upon the earth; they proceed simultaneously by code and by territoriality. The strata are judgments of God; stratification in general is the entire sys tem of the judgment of God (but the earth, or the body without organs, con stantly eludes that judgment, flees and becomes destratified, decoded, deterritorialized). Challenger quoted a sentence he said he came across in a geology text book. He said we needed to learn it by heart because we would only be in a position to understand it later on: "A surface of stratification is a more compact plane of consistency lying between two layers." The layers are the strata. They come at least in pairs, one serving as *substratum *for the other. The surface of stratification is a machinic assemblage distinct from the strata. The assemblage is between two layers, between two strata; on one side it faces the strata (in this direction, the assemblage is an *interstratum), * but the other side faces something else, the body without organs or plane of consistency (here, it is a *metastratum). *In effect, the body without organs is itself the plane of consistency, which becomes compact or thickens at the level of the strata. God is a Lobster, or a double pincer, a double bind. Not only do strata come at least in pairs, but in a different way each stratum is double (it itself has several layers). Each stratum exhibits phenomena constitutive of *dou-  ble articulation. *Articulate twice, B-A, BA. This is not at all to say that the strata speak or are language based. Double articulation is so extremely var iable that we cannot begin with a general model, only a relatively simple case. The first articulation chooses or deducts, from unstable particle-flows, metastable molecular or quasi-molecular units  *{substances) *upon which it imposes a statistical order of connections and successions *(forms).*

1 0,000 B.C.: THE GEOLOGY OF MORALS □ 41 The second articulation establishes functional, compact, stable structures  *(forms), *and constructs the molar compounds in which these structures are simultaneously actualized *{substances). *In a geological stratum, for exam ple, the first articulation is the process of "sedimentation," which deposits units of cyclic sediment according to a statistical order: flysch, with its succession of sandstone and schist. The second articulation is the "fold ing" that sets up a stable functional structure and effects the passage from sediment to sedimentary rock. It is clear that the distinction between the two articulations is not between substances and forms. Substances are nothing other than formed matters. Forms imply a code, modes of coding and decoding. Substances as formed matters refer to territorialities and degrees of territorialization and deterritorialization. But each articulation has a code *and *a territoriality; therefore each possesses both form and substance. For now, all we can say is that each articulation has a corresponding type of segmentarity or multi plicity: one type is supple, more molecular, and merely ordered; the other is more rigid, molar, and organized. Although the first articulation is not lacking in systematic interactions, it is in the second articulation in partic ular that phenomena constituting an overcoding are produced, phenom ena of centering, unification, totalization, integration, hierarchization, and finalization. Both articulations establish binary relations between their respective segments. But between the segments of one articulation and the segments of the other there are biunivocal relationships obeying far more complex laws. The word "structure" may be used to designate the sum of these relations and relationships, but it is an illusion to believe that structure is the earth's last word. Moreover, it cannot be taken for granted that the distinction between the two articulations is always that of the molecular and the molar. He skipped over the immense diversity of the energetic, physico-chemical, and geological strata. He went straight to the organic strata, or the existence of a great organic stratification. The problem of the organism—*how to "make" the body an organism*—is once again a problem of articulation, of the articulatory relation. The Dogons, well known to the professor, formulate the problem as follows: an organism befalls the body of the smith, by virtue of a machine or machinic assemblage that stratifies it. "The shock of the hammer and the anvil broke his arms and legs at the elbows and knees, which until that moment he had not possessed. In this way, he received the articulations specific to the new human form that was to spread across the earth, a form dedicated to work.... His arm became folded with a view to work." 2 It is obviously only a manner of speaking to limit the articulatory relation to the bones. The entire organism must be considered in relation to a double articulation, and on different levels.

4 2 D 10,000 B.C.: THE GEOLOGY OF MORALS First, on the level of morphogenesis: on the one hand, realities of the molecular type with aleatory relations are caught up in crowd phenomena or statistical aggregates determining an order (the protein fiber and its sequence or segmentarity); on the other hand, these aggregates themselves are taken up into stable structures that "elect" stereoscopic compounds, form organs, functions, and regulations, organize molar mechanisms, and even distribute centers capable of overflying crowds, overseeing mecha nisms, utilizing and repairing tools, "overcoding" the aggregate (the fold ing back on itself of the fiber to form a compact structure; a second kind of segmentarity). 3 Sedimentation and folding, fiber and infolding. On a different level, the cellular chemistry presiding over the constitu tion of proteins also operates by double articulation. This double articula tion is internal to the molecular, it is the articulation between small and large molecules, a segmentarity by successive modifications and polymeri zation. "First, the elements taken from the medium are combined through a series of transformations.. . .All this activity involves hundreds of chem ical reactions. But ultimately, it produces a limited number of small com pounds, a few dozen at most. In the second stage of cellular chemistry, the small molecules are assembled to produce larger ones. It is the polymeriza tion of units linked end-to-end that forms the characteristic chains of mac-romolecules. . .. The two stages of cellular chemistry, therefore, differ in their function, products and nature. The first carves out chemical motifs; the second assembles them. The first forms compounds that exist only temporarily, for they are intermediaries on the path of biosynthesis; the second constructs stable products. The first operates by a series of different reactions; the second by repeating the same reaction." 4 There is, moreover, a third level, upon which cellular chemistry itself depends. It is the genetic code, which is in turn inseparable from a double segmentarity or a double articulation, this time between two types of independent molecules: the sequence of protein units and the sequence of nucleic units, with binary relations between units of the same type and biunivocal relationships between units of different types. Thus there are always two articulations, two segmentarities, two kinds of multiplicity, each of which brings into play both forms and substances. But the distribution of these two articulations is not constant, even within the same stratum. The audience rather sulkily denounced the numerous misunderstand ings, misinterpretations, and even misappropriations in the professor's presentation, despite the authorities he had appealed to, calling them his "friends." Even the Dogons . . . And things would presently get worse. The professor cynically congratulated himself on taking his pleasure from behind, but the offspring always turned out to be runts and wens, bits and pieces, if not stupid vulgarizations. Besides, the professor was not a geolo

1 0,000 B.C.: THE GEOLOGY OF MORALS □ 43 gist or a biologist, he was not even a linguist, ethnologist, or psychoanalyst; what his specialty had been was long since forgotten. In fact, Professor Challenger was double, articulated twice, and that did not make things any easier, people never knew which of him was present. He (?) claimed to have invented a discipline he referred to by various names: rhizomatics, stratoanalysis, schizoanalysis, nomadology, micropolitics, pragmatics, the science of multiplicities. Yet no one clearly understood what the goals, method, or principles of this discipline were. Young Professor Alasca, Challenger's pet student, tried hypocritically to defend him by explaining that on a given stratum the passage from one articulation to the other was easily verified because it was always accompanied by a loss of water, in genetics as in geology, and even in linguistics, where the importance of the "lost saliva" phenomenon is measured. Challenger took offense, preferring to cite his friend, as he called him, the Danish Spinozist geologist, Hjelmslev, that dark prince descended from Hamlet who also made lan guage his concern, precisely in order to analyze its "stratification." Hjelmslev was able to weave a net out of the notions *of matter, content *and  *expression,form *and *substance. *These were the strata, said Hjelmslev. Now this net had the advantage of breaking with the form-content duality, since there was a form of content no less than a form of expression. Hjelmslev's enemies saw this merely as a way of rebaptizing the discredited notions of the signified and signifier, but something quite different was actually going on. Despite what Hjelmslev himself may have said, the net is not linguistic in scope or origin (the same must be said of double articulation: if language has a specificity of its own, as it most certainly does, that specificity con sists neither in double articulation nor in Hjelmslev's net, which are gen eral characteristics of strata). He used the term *matter *for the plane of consistency or Body without Organs, in other words, the unformed, unorganized, nonstratified, or destratified body and all its flows: subatomic and submolecular particles, pure intensities, prevital and prephysical free singularities. He used the term *content *for formed matters, which would now have to be considered from two points of view: substance, insofar as these matters are "chosen," and form, insofar as they are chosen in a certain order *{substance and form  of content). *He used the term *expression *for functional structures, which would also have to be considered from two points of view: the organization of their own specific form, and substances insofar as they form compounds  *(form and content of expression). *A stratum always has a dimension of the expressible or of expression serving as the basis for a relative invariance; for example, nucleic sequences are inseparable from a relatively invariant expression by means of which they determine the compounds, organs, and functions of the organism. 5 To express is always to sing the glory of God.

4 4 □ 10,000 B.C.: THE GEOLOGY OF MORALS Every stratum is a judgment of God; not only do plants and animals, orchids and wasps, sing or express themselves, but so do rocks and even riv ers, every stratified thing on earth. *The first articulation concerns content,  the second expression. *The distinction between the two articulations is not between forms and substances but between content and expression, expression having just as much substance as content and content just as much form as expression. The double articulation sometimes coincides with the molecular and the molar, and sometimes not; this is because con tent and expression are sometimes divided along those lines and some times along different lines. There is never correspondence or conformity between content and expression, only isomorphism with reciprocal pre supposition. The distinction between content and expression is *always  real, *in various ways, but it cannot be said that the terms preexist their dou ble articulation. It is the double articulation that distributes them accord ing to the line it draws in each stratum; it is what constitutes their real distinction. (On the other hand, there is no real distinction between form and substance, only a mental or modal distinction: since substances are nothing other than formed matters, formless substances are inconceivable, although it is possible in certain instances to conceive of substanceless forms.) Even though there is a real distinction between them, content and expression are relative terms ("first" and "second" articulation should also be understood in an entirely relative fashion). Even though it is capable of invariance, expression is just as much a variable as content. Content and expression are two variables of a function of stratification. They not only vary from one stratum to another, but intermingle, and within the same stratum multiply and divide ad infinitum. Since every articulation is dou ble, there is not an articulation of content *and *an articulation of expression—the articulation of content is double in its own right and con stitutes a relative expression within content; the articulation of expression is also double and constitutes a relative content within expression. For this reason, there exist *intermediate states *between content and expression, expression and content: the levels, equilibriums, and exchanges through which a stratified system passes. In short, we find forms and substances of content that play the role of expression in relation to other forms and sub stances, and conversely for expression. These new distinctions do not, therefore, coincide with the distinction between forms and substances within each articulation; instead, they show that each articulation is already, or still, double. This can be seen on the organic stratum: proteins of content have two forms, one of which (the infolded fiber) plays the role of functional expression in relation to the other. The same goes for the nucleic acids of expression: double articulations cause certain formal and

10,000 B.C.: THE GEOLOGY OF MORALS □ 45 substantial elements to play the role of content in relation to others; not only does the half of the chain that is reproduced become a content, but the reconstituted chain itself becomes a content in relation to the "messenger." There are double pincers everywhere on a stratum; everywhere and in all directions there are double binds and lobsters, a multiplicity of double articulations affecting both expression and content. Through all of this, Hjelmslev's warning should not be forgotten: "The terms expression plane and content plane ... are chosen in conformity with established notions and are quite arbitrary. Their functional definition provides no justifica tion for calling one, and not the other, of these entities *expression, *or one, and not the other, *content. *They are defined only by their mutual solidarity, and neither of them can be identified otherwise. They are defined only oppositively and relatively, as mutually opposed functives of one and the same function." 6 We must combine all the resources of real distinction, reciprocal presupposition, and general relativism. The question we must ask is what on a given stratum varies and what does not. What accounts for the unity and diversity of a stratum? Matter, the pure matter of the plane of consistency (or inconsistency) lies outside the strata. The molecular materials borrowed from the substrata may be the same throughout a stratum, but that does not mean that the molecules will be the same. The substantial elements may be the same throughout the stratum without the substances being the same. The formal relations or bonds may be the same without the forms being the same. In biochemistry, there is a *unity of composition *of the organic stratum defined at the level of materials and energy, substantial elements or radicals, bonds and reac tions. But there is a variety of different molecules, substances, and forms. Should we not sing the praise of Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire? For in the nine teenth century he developed a grandiose conception of stratification. He said that matter, considered from the standpoint of its greatest divisibility, consists in particles of decreasing size, flows or elastic fluids that "deploy themselves" by radiating through space. Combustion is the process of this escape or infinite division on the plane of consistency. Electrification is the opposite process, constitutive of strata; it is the process whereby similar particles group together to form atoms and molecules, similar molecules to form bigger molecules, and the biggest molecules to form molar aggregates: "the attraction of like by like," as in a double pincer or double articulation. Thus there is no vital matter specific to the organic stratum, matter is the same on all the strata. But the organic stratum does have a specific unity of composition, a single abstract Animal, a single machine embedded in the stratum, and presents everywhere the same molecular materials, the same elements or anatomical components of organs, the same formal connec

It is of little or no impor tance that Geoffroy chose anatomical elements as the substantial units rather than protein and nucleic acid radicals. At any rate, he already invoked a whole interplay of molecules. The important thing is the princi ple of the simultaneous unity and variety of the stratum: isomorphism of forms but no correspondence; identity of elements or components but no identity of compound substances. This is where the dialogue, or rather violent debate, with Cuvier came in. To keep the last of the audience from leaving, Challenger imagined a particularly epistemological dialogue of the dead, in puppet theater style. Geoffroy called forth Monsters, Cuvier laid out all the Fossils in order, Baer flourished flasks filled with embryos, Vialleton put on a tetrapod's belt, Perrier mimed the dramatic battle between the Mouth and the Brain, and so on. *Geoffroy: *The proof that there is isomorphism is that you can always get from one form on the organic stratum to another, however dif ferent they may be, by means of "folding." To go from the Vertebrate to the Cephalopod, bring the two sides of the Vertebrate's backbone together, bend its head down to its feet and its pelvis up to the nape of its neck ...  *Cuvier *(angrily): That's just not true! You go from an Elephant to a Medusa; I know, I tried. There are irreducible axes, types, branches. There are resemblances between organs and analogies between forms, nothing more. You're a falsifier, a metaphysician. *Vialleton *(a disciple of Cuvier and Baer): Even if folding gave good results, who could endure it? It's not by chance that Geoffroy only considers anatomical elements. No muscle or ligament would survive it. *Geoffroy. *I said that there was isomorphism but not correspondence. You have to bring "degrees of development or perfec tion" into the picture. It is not everywhere on a stratum that materials reach the degree at which they form a given aggregate. Anatomical ele ments may be arrested or inhibited in certain places by molecular clashes, the influence of the milieu, or pressure from neighbors to such an extent that they compose different organs. The same formal relations or connec tions are then effectuated in entirely different forms and arrangements. It is still the same abstract Animal that is realized throughout the stratum, only to varying degrees, in varying modes. Each time, it is as perfect as its surroundings or milieu allows it to be (it is obviously not yet a question of evolution: neither folding nor degrees imply descent or derivation, only autonomous realizations of the same abstract relations). This is where Geoffroy invoked Monsters: human monsters are embryos that were retarded at a certain degree of development, the human in them is only a straitjacket for inhuman forms and substances. Yes, the Heteradelph is a crustacean. *Baer *(an ally of Cuvier and contemporary of Darwin, about

1 0,000 B.C.: THE GEOLOGY OF MORALS □ 47 whom he had reservations, in addition to being an enemy of Geoffroy): That's not true, you can't confuse degrees of development with types of forms. A single type has several degrees, a single degree is found in several types, but never will you make types out of degrees. An embryo of one type cannot display another type; at most, it can be of the same degree as an embryo of the second type. *Vialleton *(a disciple of Baer's who took both Darwin and Geoffroy one further): And then there are things that only an embryo can do or endure. It can do or endure these things precisely because of its type, not because it can go from one type to another according to degrees of development. Admire the Tortoise. Its neck requires that a cer tain number of protovertebrae change position, and its front limbs must slide 180 degrees in relation to that of a bird. You can never draw conclu sions about phylogenesis on the basis of embryogenesis. Folding does not make it possible to go from one type to another; quite the contrary, the types testify to the irreducibility of the forms of folding ... (Thus Vialleton presented two kinds of interconnected arguments in the service of the same cause, saying first that there are things no animal can do by reason of its substance, and then that there are things that only an embryo can do by rea son of its form. Two strong arguments.) 7 We're a little lost now. There is so much going on in these retorts. So many endlessly proliferating distinctions. So much getting even, for episte-mology is not innocent. The sweet and subtle Geoffroy and the violent and serious Cuvier do battle around Napoleon. Cuvier, the rigid specialist, is pitted against Geoffroy, always ready to switch specialities. Cuvier hates Geoffroy, he can't stomach Geoffroy's lighthearted formulas, his humor (yes, Hens do indeed have teeth, the Lobster has skin on its bones, etc.). Cuvier is a man of Power and Terrain, and he won't let Geoffroy forget it; Geoffroy, on the other hand, prefigures the nomadic man of speed. Cuvier reflects a Euclidean space, whereas Geoffroy thinks topologically. Today let us invoke the folds of the cortex with all their paradoxes. Strata are topological, and Geoffroy is a great artist of the fold, a formidable artist; as such, he already has a presentiment of a certain kind of animal rhizome with aberrant paths of communication—Monsters. Cuvier reacts in terms of discontinuous photographs, and casts of fossils. But we're a little lost, because distinctions have proliferated in all directions. We have not even taken Darwin, evolutionism, or neoevolutionism into account yet. This, however, is where a decisive phenomenon occurs: our puppet theater becomes more and more nebulous, in other words, collec tive and differential. Earlier, we invoked two factors, and their uncertain relations, in order to explain the diversity within a stratum—degrees of development or perfection and types of forms. They now undergo a pro found transformation. There is a double tendency for types of forms to be

4 8 □ 10,000 B.C.: THE GEOLOGY OF MORALS understood increasingly in terms of populations, packs and colonies, collectivities or multiplicities; and degrees of development in terms of speeds, rates, coefficients, and differential relations. A double deepening. This, Darwinism's fundamental contribution, implies a new coupling of individuals and milieus on the stratum. 8 First, if we assume the presence of an elementary or even molecular pop ulation in a given milieu, the forms do not preexist the population, they are more like statistical results. The more a population assumes divergent forms, the more its multiplicity divides into multiplicities of different nature, the more its elements form distinct compounds or matters—the more efficiently it distributes itself in the milieu, or divides up the milieu. Thus the relationship between embryogenesis and phylogenesis is reversed: the embryo does not testify to an absolute form preestablished in a closed milieu; rather, the phylogenesis of populations has at its disposal, in an open milieu, an entire range of relative forms to choose from, none of which is preestablished. In embryogenesis, "It is possible to tell from the parents, anticipating the outcome of the process, whether a pigeon or a wolf is developing.... But here the points of reference themselves are in motion: there are only fixed points for convenience of expression. At the level of universal evolution, it is impossible to discern that kind of refer ence point.... Life on earth appears as a sum of relatively independent species of flora and fauna with sometimes shifting or porous boundaries between them. Geographical areas can only harbor a sort of chaos, or, at best, extrinsic harmonies of an ecological order, temporary equilibriums between populations." 9 Second, simultaneously and under the same conditions, the degrees are not degrees of preexistent development or perfection but are instead global and relative equilibriums: they enter into play as a function of the advan tage they give particular elements, then a particular multiplicity in the milieu, and as a function of a particular variation in the milieu. Degrees are no longer measured in terms of increasing perfection or a differentiation and increase in the complexity of the parts, but in terms of differential rela tions and coefficients such as selective pressure, catalytic action, speed of propagation, rate of growth, evolution, mutation, etc. Relative progress, then, can occur by formal and quantitative simplification rather than by complication, by a loss of components and syntheses rather than by acqui sition (it is a question of speed, and speed is a differential). It is through populations that one is formed, assumes forms, and through loss that one progresses and picks up speed. Darwinism's two fundamental contribu tions move in the direction of a science of multiplicities: the substitution of populations for types, and the substitution of rates or differential relations for degrees. 10 These are nomadic contributions with shifting boundaries

1 0,000 B.C.: THE GEOLOGY OF MORALS □ 49 determined by populations or variations of multiplicities, and with differ ential coefficients or variations of relations. Contemporary biochemistry, or "molecular Darwinism" as Monod calls it, confirms, on the level of a single statistical and global individual, or a simple sample, the decisive importance of molecular populations and microbiological rates (for exam ple, the endlessness of the sequence composing a chain, and the chance var iation of a single segment in the sequence). Challenger admitted having digressed at length but added that there was no possible way to distinguish between the digressive and the nondi-gressive. The point was to arrive at several conclusions concerning the unity and diversity of a single stratum, in this case the organic stratum. To begin with, a stratum does indeed have a unity of composition, which is what allows it to be called *a *stratum: molecular materials, substantial ele ments, and formal relations or traits. Materials are not the same as the unformed matter of the plane of consistency; they are already stratified, and come from "substrata." But of course substrata should not be thought of only as substrata: in particular, their organization is no less complex than, nor is it inferior to, that of the strata; we should be on our guard against any kind of ridiculous cosmic evolutionism. The materials fur nished by a substratum are no doubt simpler than the compounds of a stra tum, but their level of organization in the substratum is no lower than that of the stratum itself. The difference between materials and substantial ele ments is one of organization; there is a change in organization, not an aug mentation. The materials furnished by the substratum constitute an  *exterior milieu *for the elements and compounds of the stratum under con sideration, but they are not exterior *to *the stratum. The elements and com pounds constitute an interior of the stratum, just as the materials constitute an exterior *of the *stratum; both belong to the stratum, the latter because they are materials that have been furnished to the stratum and selected for it, the former because they are formed from the materials. Once again, this exterior and interior are relative; they exist only through their exchanges and therefore only by virtue of the stratum responsible for the relation between them. For example, on a crystalline stratum, the amorphous milieu, or medium, is exterior to the seed before the crystal has formed; the crystal forms by interiorizing and incorporating masses of amorphous material. Conversely, the interiority of the seed of the crystal must move out to the system's exterior, where the amorphous medium can crystallize (the aptitude to switch over to the other form of organization). To the point that the seed itself comes from the outside. In short, both exte rior and interior are interior to the stratum. The same applies to the organic stratum: the materials furnished by the substrata are an exterior medium constituting the famous prebiotic soup, and catalysts play the role of seed

5 0 □ 10,000 B.C.: THE GEOLOGY OF MORALS in the formation of interior substantial elements or even compounds. These elements and compounds both appropriate materials and exteri orize themselves through replication, even in the conditions of the primor dial soup itself. Once again, interior and exterior exchange places, and both are interior to the organic stratum. The limit between them is the mem brane that regulates the exchanges and transformation in organization (in other words, the distributions interior to the stratum) and that defines all of the stratum's formal relations or traits (even though the situation and role of the limit vary widely depending on the stratum, for example, the limit of the crystal as compared to the cellular membrane). We may there fore use the term central layer, or central ring, for the following aggregate comprising the unity of composition of a stratum: exterior molecular materials, interior substantial elements, and the limit or membrane con veying the formal relations. There is a single *abstract machine *that is envel oped by the stratum and constitutes its unity. This is the Ecumenon, as opposed to the Planomenon of the plane of consistency. It would be a mistake to believe that it is possible to isolate this unitary, central layer of the stratum, or to grasp it in itself, by regression. In the first place, a stratum necessarily goes from layer to layer, and from the very beginning. It already has several layers. It goes from a center to a periphery, at the same time as the periphery reacts back upon the center to form a new center in relation to a new periphery. Flows constantly radiate outward, then turn back. There is an outgrowth and multiplication of intermediate states, and this process is one of the local conditions of the central ring (different concentrations, variations that are tolerated below a certain threshold of identity). These intermediate states present new figures of milieus or materials, as well as of elements and compounds. They are inter mediaries between the exterior milieu and the interior element, substantial elements and their compounds, compounds and substances, and between the different formed substances (substances of content and substances of expression). We will use the term *epistrata *for these intermediaries and superpositions, these outgrowths, these levels. Returning to our two exam ples, on the crystalline stratum there are many intermediaries between the exterior milieu or material and the interior seed: a multiplicity of perfectly discontinuous states of metastability constituting so many hierarchical degrees. Neither is the organic stratum separable from so-called interior milieus that are interior elements in relation to exterior materials but also exterior elements in relation to interior substances." These internal organic milieus are known to regulate the degree of complexity or differen tiation of the parts of an organism. A stratum, considered from the stand point of its unity of composition, therefore exists only in its substantial epistrata, which shatter its continuity, fragment its ring, and break it down

1 0,000 B.C.: THE GEOLOGY OF MORALS □ 51 into gradations. The central ring does not exist independently of a periph ery that forms a new center, reacts back upon the first center, and in turn gives forth discontinuous epistrata. That is not all. In addition to this new or second-degree relativity of inte rior and exterior, there is a whole history on the level of the membrane or limit. To the extent that elements and compounds incorporate or appropri ate materials, the corresponding organisms are forced to turn to other "more foreign and less convenient" materials that they take from still intact masses or other organisms. The milieu assumes a third figure here: it is no longer an interior or exterior milieu, even a relative one, nor an inter mediate milieu, but instead an *annexed or associated milieu. *Associated milieus imply sources of energy different from alimentary materials. Before these sources are obtained, the organism can be said to nourish itself but not to breathe: it is in a state of suffocation. *n* * *Obtaining an energy source permits an increase in the number of materials that can be trans formed into elements and compounds. The associated milieu is thus defined by the capture of energy sources (respiration in the most general sense), by the discernment of materials, the sensing of their presence or absence (perception), and by the fabrication or nonfabrication of the corre sponding compounds (response, reaction). That there are molecular per ceptions no less than molecular reactions can be seen in the economy of the cell and the property of regulatory agents to "recognize" only one or two kinds of chemicals in a very diverse milieu of exteriority. The development of the associated milieus culminates in the animal worlds described by von Uexkull, with all their active, perceptive, and energetic characteristics. The unforgettable associated world of the Tick, defined by its gravitational energy of falling, its olfactory characteristic of perceiving sweat, and its active characteristic of latching on: the tick climbs a branch and drops onto a passing mammal it has recognized by smell, then latches onto its skin (an associated world composed of three factors, and no more). Active and per ceptive characteristics are themselves something of a double pincer, a dou ble articulation. 13 Here, the associated milieus are closely related to organic forms. An organic form is not a simple structure but a structuration, the constitution of an associated milieu. An animal milieu, such as the spider web, is no less "morphogenetic" than the form of the organism. One certainly cannot say that the milieu determines the form; but to complicate things, this does not make the relation between form and milieu any less decisive. Since the form depends on an autonomous code, it can only be constituted in an associated milieu that interlaces active, perceptive, and energetic charac teristics in a complex fashion, in conformity with the code's requirements; and the form can develop only through intermediary milieus that regulate

52 D 10,000 B.C.: THE GEOLOGY OF MORALS the speeds and rates of its substances; and it can experience itself only in a milieu of exteriority that measures the comparative advantages of the asso ciated milieus and the differential relations of the intermediary milieus. Milieus always act, through selection, on entire organisms, the forms of which depend on codes those milieus sanction indirectly. Associated milieus divide a single milieu of exteriority among themselves as a func tion of different forms, just as intermediate milieus divide a milieu of exteriority among themselves as a function of the rates or degrees of a sin gle form. But the dividing is done differently in the two cases. In relation to the central belt of the stratum, the intermediate strata or milieus constitute "epistrata" piled one atop the other, and form new centers for the new peripheries. We will apply the term "parastrata" to the second way in which the central belt fragments into sides and "besides," and the irreducible forms and milieus associated with them. This time, it is at the level of the limit or membrane of the central belt that the formal relations or traits common to all of the strata necessarily assume entirely different forms or types of forms corresponding to the parastrata. A stratum exists only in its epistrata and parastrata, so that in the final analysis these must be consid ered strata in their own right. The ideally continuous belt or ring of the stratum—the Ecumenon defined by the identity of molecular materials, substantial elements, and formal relations—exists only as shattered, frag mented into epistrata and parastrata that imply concrete machines and their respective indexes, and constitute different molecules, specific sub stances, and irreducible forms. 14 We may now return to the two fundamental contributions of Darwinism and answer the question of why forms or types of forms in the parastrata must be understood in relation to populations, and degrees of develop ment in the epistrata as rates or differential relations. First, parastrata envelop the very codes upon which the forms depend, and these codes nec essarily apply to populations. There must already be an entire molecular population to be coded, and the effects of the code, or a change in the code, are evaluated in relation to a more or less molar population, depending on the code's ability to propagate in the milieu or create for itself a new associ ated milieu within which the modification will be popularizable. Yes, we must always think in terms of packs and multiplicities: a code does or does not take hold because the coded individual belongs to a certain population, "the population inhabiting test tubes, a flask full of water, or a mammal's intestine." What does it mean to say that new forms and associated milieus potentially result from a change in the code, a modification of the code, or a variation in the parastratum? The change is obviously not due to a passage from one preestablished form to another, in other words, a translation from one code to another. As long as the problem was formulated in that

10,000 B.C.: THE GEOLOGY OF MORALS □ 53 fashion, it remained insoluble, and one would have to agree with Cuvier and Baer that established types of forms are irreducible and therefore do not admit of translation or transformation. But as soon as it is recognized that a code is inseparable from a process of decoding that is inherent to it, the problem receives a new formulation. There is no genetics without "genetic drift." The modern theory of mutations has clearly demonstrated that a code, which necessarily relates to a population, has an essential mar gin of decoding: not only does every code have supplements capable of free variation, but a single segment may be copied twice, the second copy left free for variation. In addition, fragments of code may be transferred from the cells of one species to those of another, Man and Mouse, Monkey and Cat, by viruses or through other procedures. This involves not translation between codes (viruses are not translators) but a singular phenomenon we call surplus value of code, or side-communication.' 5 We will have occasion to discuss this further, for it is essential to all becomings-animal. Every code is affected by a margin of decoding due to these supplements and sur plus values—supplements in the order of a multiplicity, surplus values in the order of a rhizome. Forms in the parastrata, the parastrata themselves, far from lying immobile and frozen upon the strata, are part of a machinic interlock: they relate to populations, populations imply codes, and codes fundamentally include phenomena of relative decoding that are all the more usable, composable, and addable by virtue of being relative, always "beside." Forms relate to codes and processes of coding and decoding in the parastrata; substances, being formed matters, relate to territorialities and movements of deterritorialization and reterritorialization on the epis-trata. In truth, the epistrata are just as inseparable from the movements that constitute them as the parastrata are from their processes. Nomadic waves or flows of deterritorialization go from the central layer to the periphery, then from the new center to the new periphery, falling back to the old center and launching forth to the new. 16 The organization of the epistrata moves in the direction of increasing deterritorialization. Physical particles and chemical substances cross thresholds of deterritorialization on their own stratum and between strata; these thresholds correspond to more or less stable intermediate states, to more or less transitory valences and existences, to engagements with this or that other body, to densities of proximity, to more or less localizable connections. Not only are physical particles characterized by speeds of deterritorialization—Joycean tachyons, particles-holes, and quarks recalling the fundamental idea of the "soup"—but a single chemical substance (sulfur or carbon, for example) has a number of more and less deterritorialized states. The more interior milieus an organism has on its own stratum, assuring its autonomy and

5 4 O 10,000 B . C : THE GEOLOGY OF MORALS bringing it into a set of aleatory relations with the exterior, the more deterritorialized it is. That is why degrees of development must be under stood relatively, and as a function of differential speeds, relations, and rates. Deterritorialization must be thought of as a perfectly positive power that has degrees and thresholds (epistrata), is always relative, and has reterritorialization as its flipside or complement. An organism that is deterritorialized in relation to the exterior necessarily reterritorializes on its interior milieus. A given presumed fragment of embryo is deterrito rialized when it changes thresholds or gradients, but is assigned a new role by the new surroundings. Local movements are alterations. Cellular migra tion, stretching, invagination, folding are examples of this. Every voyage is intensive, and occurs in relation to thresholds of intensity between which it evolves or that it crosses. One travels by intensity; displacements and spatial figures depend on intensive thresholds of nomadic deterritoriali zation (and thus on differential relations) that simultaneously define com plementary, sedentary reterritorializations. Every stratum operates this way: by grasping in its pincers a maximum number of intensities or inten sive particles over which it spreads its forms and substances, constituting determinate gradients and thresholds of resonance (deterritorialization on a stratum always occurs in relation to a complementary reterrito rialization). 17 As long as preestablished forms were compared to predetermined degrees, all one could do was affirm their irreducibility, and there was no way of judging possible communication between the two factors. But we see now that forms depend on codes in the parastrata and plunge into pro cesses of decoding or drift and that degrees themselves are caught up in movements of intensive territorialization and reterritorialization. There is no simple correspondence between codes and territorialities on the one hand and decodings and deterritorialization on the other: on the contrary, a code may be a deterritorialization and a reterritorialization a decoding. Wide gaps separate code and territoriality. The two factors nevertheless have the same "subject" in a stratum: it is populations that are deter ritorialized and reterritorialized, and also coded and decoded. In addition, these factors communicate or interlace in the milieus. On the one hand, modifications of a code have an aleatory cause in the milieu of exteriority, and it is their effects on the interior milieus, their compatibility with them, that decide whether they will be popularized. Deterritorializations and reterritorializations do not bring about the mod ifications; they do, however, strictly determine their selection. On the other hand, every modification has an associated milieu that in turn entails a certain deterritorialization in relation to the milieu of exteriority and a cer tain reterritorialization on intermediate or interior milieus.

1 0,000 B.C.: THE GEOLOGY OF MORALS □ 55 and actions in an associated milieu, even those on a molecular level, con struct or produce *territorial signs *(indexes). This is especially true of an ani mal world, which is constituted, marked off by signs that divide it into zones (of shelter, hunting, neutrality, etc.), mobilize special organs, and correspond to fragments of code; this is so even at the margin of decoding inherent in the code. Even the domain of learning is defined by the code, or prescribed by it. But indexes or territorial signs are inseparable from a dou ble movement. Since the associated milieu always confronts a milieu of exteriority with which the animal is engaged and in which it takes neces sary risks, a *line of flight *must be preserved to enable the animal to regain its associated milieu when danger appears (for example, the bull's line of flight in the arena, which it uses to regain the turf it has chosen). 18 A second kind of line of flight arises when the associated milieu is rocked by blows from the exterior, forcing the animal to abandon it and strike up an associa tion with new portions of exteriority, this time leaning on its interior milieus like fragile crutches. When the seas dried, the primitive Fish left its associated milieu to explore land, forced to "stand on its own legs," now carrying water only on the inside, in the amniotic membranes protecting the embryo. In one way or the other, the animal is more a fleer than a fighter, but its flights are also conquests, creations. Territorialities, then, are shot through with lines of flight testifying to the presence within them of movements of deterritorialization and reterritorialization. In a certain sense, they are secondary. They would be nothing without these move ments that deposit them. In short, the epistrata and parastrata are continu ally moving, sliding, shifting, and changing on the Ecumenon or unity of composition of a stratum; some are swept away by lines of flight and move ments of deterritorialization, others by processes of decoding or drift, but they all communicate at the intersection of the milieus. The strata are con tinually being shaken by phenomena of cracking and rupture, either at the level of the substrata that furnish the materials (a prebiotic soup, a prechemical soup ...), at the level of the accumulating epistrata, or at the level of the abutting parastrata: everywhere there arise simultaneous accel erations and blockages, comparative speeds, differences in deterrito rialization creating relative fields of reterritorialization. These relative movements should most assuredly not be confused with the possibility of absolute deterritorialization, an absolute line of flight, absolute drift. The former are stratic or interstratic, whereas the latter con cern the plane of consistency and its destratification (its "combustion," as Geoffroy would say). There is no doubt that mad physical particles crash through the strata as they accelerate, leaving minimal trace of their pas sage, escaping spatiotemporal and even existential coordinates as they tend toward a state of absolute deterritorialization, the state of unformed

5 6 □ 10,000 B.C.: THE GEOLOGY OF MORALS matter on the plane of consistency. In a certain sense, the acceleration of relative deterritorializations reaches the sound barrier: if the particles bounce off this wall, or allow themselves to be captured by black holes, they fall back onto the strata, into the strata's relations and milieus; but if they cross the barrier they reach the unformed, destratified element of the plane of consistency. *We may even say the the abstract machines that emit and  combine particles have two very different modes of existence: the Ecumenon  and the Planomenon. *Either the abstract machines remain prisoner to stratifications, are enveloped in a certain specific stratum whose program or unity of composition they define (the abstract Animal, the abstract chemical Body, Energy in itself) and whose movements of relative deterritorialization they regulate, Or, on the contrary, the abstract machine cuts across all stratifications, develops alone and in its own right on the plane of consistency whose diagram it constitutes, the same machine at work in astrophysics and in microphysics, in the natural and in the artifi cial, piloting flows of absolute deterritorialization (in no sense, of course, is unformed matter chaos of any kind). But this presentation is still too simplified. First, one does not go from the relative to the absolute simply by acceler ation, even though increases in speed tend to have this comparative and global result. Absolute deterritorialization is not defined as a giant acceler ator; its absoluteness does not hinge on how fast it goes. It is actually possi ble to reach the absolute by way of phenomena of relative slowness or delay. Retarded development is an example. What qualifies a deterritorialization is not its speed (some are very slow) but its nature, whether it constitutes epistrata and parastrata and proceeds by articulated segments or, on the contrary, jumps from one singularity to another following a nondecom-posable, nonsegmentary line drawing a metastratum of the plane of consistency. Second, under no circumstances must it be thought that absolute deterritorialization comes suddenly of afterward, is in excess or beyond. That would preclude any understanding of why the strata themselves are animated by movements of relative deterritorialization and decoding that are not like accidents occurring on them. In fact, what is primary is an absolute deterritorialization an absolute line of flight, however complex or multiple—that of the plane of consistency or body without organs (the Earth, the absolutely deterritorialized). This absolute deterritorialization becomes relative only after stratification occurs on that plane or body: It is the strata that are always residue, not the opposite. The question is not how something manages to leave the strata by how things get into them in the first place. There is a perpetual immanence of absolute deterritorialization within relative deterritorialization; and the machinic assemblages between strata that regulate the differential relations and relative

The plane of consistency is always immanent to the strata; the two states of the abstract machine always coexist as two different states of intensities. Most of the audience had left (the first to go were the Marinetians with their double articulation, followed by the Hjelmslevians with their content and expression, and the biologists with their proteins and nucleic acids). The only ones left were the mathematicians, accustomed to other follies, along with a few astrologers, archaeologists, and scattered individuals. Challenger, moreover, had changed since the beginning of his talk. His voice had become hoarser, broken occasionally by an apish cough. His dream was not so much to give a lecture to humans as to provide a program for pure computers. Or else he was dreaming of an axiomatic, for axi-omatics deals essentially with stratification. Challenger was addressing himself to memory only. Now that we had discussed what was constant and what varied in a stratum from the standpoint of substances and forms, the question remaining to be answered was what varied between strata from the standpoint of content and expression. For if it is true that there is always a real distinction constitutive of double articulation, a reciprocal presupposition of content and expression, then what varies from one stratum to another is the nature of this real distinction, and the nature and respective positions of the terms distinguished. Let us start with a certain group of strata that can be characterized summarily as follows: on these strata, content (form and substance) is molecular, and expression (form and substance) is molar. The difference between the two is primarily one of order of magnitude or scale. Resonance, or the communication occurring between the two independent orders, is what institutes the stratified system. The molecular content of that system has its own form corresponding to the distribution of elemental masses and the action of one molecule upon another; similarly, expression has a form manifesting the statistical aggregate and state of equilibrium existing on the macroscopic level. Expression is like an "operation of amplifying structuration carrying the active properties of the originally microphysical discontinuity to the macrophysical level." We took as our point of departure cases of this kind on the geological stratum, the crystalline stratum, and physicochemical strata, wherever the molar can be said to express microscopic molecular interactions ("the crys tal is the macroscopic expression of a microscopic structure"; the "crystal line form expresses certain atomic or molecular characteristics of the constituent chemical categories"). Of course, this still leaves numerous possibilities, depending on the number and nature of the intermediate

5 8 □ 10,000 B.C.: THE GEOLOGY OF MORALS states, and also on the impact of exterior forces on the formation of expres sion. There may be a greater or lesser number of intermediate states between the molecular and the molar; there may be a greater or lesser num ber of exterior forces or organizing centers participating in the molar form. Doubtless, these two factors are in an inverse relation to each other and indicate limit-cases. For example, the molar form of expression may be of the "mold" type, mobilizing a maximum of exterior forces; or it may be of the "modulation" type, bringing into play only a minimum number of them. Even in the case of the mold, however, there are nearly instantane ous, interior intermediate states between the molecular content that assumes its own specific forms and the determinate molar expression of the outside by the form of the mold. Conversely, even when the multiplica tion and temporalization of the intermediate states testify to the endo genous character of the molar form (as with crystals), a minimum of exterior forces still intervene in each of the stages. 19 We must therefore say that the relative independence of content and expression, the real distinc tion between molecular content and molar expression with their respective forms, has a special status enjoying a certain amount of latitude between the limit-cases. Since strata are judgments of God, one should not hesitate to apply all the subtleties of medieval Scholasticism and theology. There is a real dis tinction between content and expression because the corresponding forms are effectively distinct in the "thing" itself, and not only in the mind of the observer. But this real distinction is quite special; it is only *formal *since the two forms compose or shape a single thing, a single stratified subject. Vari ous examples of formal distinction can be cited: between scales or orders of magnitude (as between a map and its model; or, in a different fashion, between the micro- and macrophysical levels, as in the parable of Eddington's two offices); between the various states or formal reasons through which a thing passes; between the thing in one form, and as affected by a possibly exterior causality giving it a different form; and so forth. (There is a proliferation of distinct forms because, in addition to content and expression each having its own forms, intermediate states introduce forms of expression proper to content and forms of content proper to expression.) As diverse and real as formal distinctions are, on the organic stratum the very nature of the distinction changes. As a result, the entire distribution between content and expression is different. The organic stratum never theless preserves, and even amplifies, the relation between the molecular and the molar, with all kinds of intermediate states. We saw this in the case of morphogenesis, where double articulation is inseparable from a com munication between two orders of magnitude. The same thing applies to

1 0,000 B.C.: THE GEOLOGY OF MORALS D 59 cellular chemistry. But the organic stratum has a unique character that must account for the amplifications. In a preceding discussion, expression was dependent upon the expressed molecular content in all directions and in every dimension and had independence only to the extent that it appealed to a higher order of magnitude and to exterior forces: The real dis tinction was between forms, but forms belonging to the same aggregate, the same thing or subject. *Now, however, expression becomes independent in its  own right, in other words, autonomous. *Before, the coding of a stratum was coextensive with that stratum; on the organic stratum, on the other hand, it takes place on an autonomous and independent line that detaches as much as possible from the second and third dimensions. Expression ceases to be voluminous or superficial, becoming linear, unidimensional (even in its segmentarity). The essential thing is *the linearity of the nucleic sequence.* *20 * The real distinction between content and expression, therefore, is not sim ply formal. It is strictly speaking real, and passes into the molecular, with out regard to order of magnitude. It is between two classes of molecules, nucleic acids of expression and proteins of content, nucleic elements or nucleotides and protein elements or amino acids. Both expression and content are now molecular *and *molar. The distinction no longer concerns a single aggregate or subject; linearity takes us further in the direction of flat multiplicities, rather than unity. Expression involves nucleotides and nucleic acids as well as molecules that, in their substance and form, are entirely independent not only of molecules of content but of any directed action in the exterior milieu. Thus invariance is a characteristic of certain molecules and is not found exclusively on the molar scale. Conversely, pro teins, in their substance and form of content, are equally independent of nucleotides: the only thing univocally determined is that one amino acid rather than another corresponds to a sequence of three nucleotides. 2 ' What the linear form of expression determines is therefore a derivative form of expression, one that is relative to content and that, through a folding back upon itself of the protein sequence of the amino acids, finally yields the characteristic three-dimensional structures. In short, what is specific to the organic stratum is *this alignment of expression, this exhaustion or detach-  ment of a line of expression, *this reduction of form and substance of expres sion to a unidimensional line, guaranteeing their reciprocal independence from content without having to account for orders of magnitude. This has many consequences. The new configuration of expression and content conditions not only the organism's power to reproduce but also its power to deterritorialize or accelerate deterritorialization. The alignment of the code or linearity of the nucleic sequence in fact marks a threshold of deterritorialization of the "sign" that gives it a new ability to be copied and makes the organism more deterritorialized than a crystal: only something

60 □ 10,000 B.C.: THE GEOLOGY OF MORALS deterritorialized is capable of reproducing itself. When content and expression are divided along the lines of the molecular and the molar, sub stances move from state to state, from the preceding state to the following state, or from layer to layer, from an already constituted layer to a layer in the process of forming, while forms install themselves at the limit between the last layer or last state and the exterior milieu. Thus the stratum devel ops into epistrata and parastrata; this is accomplished through a set of  *inductions *from layer to layer and state to state, or at the limit. A crystal dis plays this process in its pure state, since its form expands in all directions, but always as a function of the surface layer of the substance, which can be emptied of most of its interior without interfering with the growth. It is the crystal's subjugation to three-dimensionality, in other words its index of territoriality, that makes the structure incapable of formally reproducing and expressing itself; only the accessible surface can reproduce itself, since it is the only deterritorializable part. On the contrary, the detachment of a pure line of expression on the organic stratum makes it possible for the organism to attain a much higher threshold of deterritorialization, gives it a mechanism of reproduction covering all the details of its complex spatial structure, and enables it to put all of its interior layers "topologically in contact" with the exterior, or rather with the polarized limit (hence the spe cial role of the living membrane). The development of the stratum into epistrata and parastrata occurs not through simple inductions but through  *transductions *that account for the amplification of the resonance between the molecular and the molar, independently of order of magnitude; for the functional efficacy of the interior substances, independently of distance; and for the possibility of a proliferation and even interlacing of forms, independently of codes (surplus values of code or phenomena of trans coding or aparallel evolution). 22 There is a third major grouping of strata, defined less by a human essence than, once again, by a new distribution of content and expression. Form of content becomes "alloplastic" rather than "homoplastic"; in other words, it brings about modifications in the external world. Form of expres sion becomes linguistic rather than genetic; in other words, it operates with symbols that are comprehensible, transmittable, and modifiable from out side. What some call the properties of human beings—technology and language, tool and symbol, free hand and supple larynx, "gesture and speech"—are in fact properties of this new distribution. It would be diffi cult to maintain that the emergence of human beings marked the absolute origin of this distribution. Leroi-Gourhan's analyses give us an under standing of how contents came to be linked with the hand-tool couple and expressions with the face-language couple. 23 In this context, the hand must not be thought of simply as an organ but instead as a coding (the digital

The hand as a general form of content is extended in tools, which are themselves active forms implying substances, or formed matters; finally, products are formed matters, or substances, which in turn serve as tools. Whereas manual formal traits constitute the unity of compo sition of the stratum, the forms and substances of tools and products are organized into parastrata and epistrata that themselves function as verita ble strata and mark discontinuities, breakages, communications and diffu sions, nomadisms and sedentarities, multiple thresholds and speeds of relative deterritorialization in human populations. For with the hand as a formal trait or general form of content a major threshold of deterri torialization is reached and opens, an accelerator that in itself permits a shifting interplay of comparative deterritorializations and reterritorial-izations—what makes this acceleration possible is, precisely, phenomena of "retarded development" in the organic substrata. Not only is the hand a deterritorialized front paw; the hand thus freed is itself deterritorialized in relation to the grasping and locomotive hand of the monkey. The synergistic deterritorializations of other organs (for example, the foot) must be taken into account. So must correlative deterritorializations of the milieu: the steppe as an associated milieu more deterritorialized than the forest, exerting a selective pressure of deterritorialization upon the body and technology (it was on the steppe, not in the forest, that the hand was able to appear as a free form, and fire as a technologically formable matter). Finally, complementary reterritorializations must be taken into account (the foot as a compensatory reterritorialization for the hand, also occurring on the steppe). Maps should be made of these things, organic, ecological, and technological maps one can lay out on the plane of consistency. On the other hand, language becomes the new form of expression, or rather the set of formal traits defining the new expression in operation throughout the stratum. Just as manual traits exist only in forms and formed matters that shatter their continuity and determine the distribution of their effects, formal traits of expression exist only in a diversity of formal languages and imply one or several formable substances. The sub stance involved is fundamentally vocal substance, which brings into play various organic elements: not only the larynx, but the mouth and lips, and the overall motricity of the face. Once again, a whole intensive map must be accounted for: the mouth as a deterritorialization of the snout (the whole "conflict between the mouth and the brain," as Perrier called it); the lips as a deterritorialization of the mouth (only humans have lips, in other words, an outward curling of the interior mucous membranes; only human females have breasts, in other words, deterritorialized mammary glands:

6 2 □ 10,000 B.C.: THE GEOLOGY OF MORALS the extended nursing period advantageous for language learning is accom panied by a complementary reterritorialization of the lips on the breasts, and the breasts on the lips). What a curious deterritorialization, filling one's mouth with words instead of food and noises. The steppe, once more, seems to have exerted strong pressures of selection: the "supple larynx" is a development corresponding to the free hand and could have arisen only in a deforested milieu where it is no longer necessary to have gigantic laryn geal sacks in order for one's cries to be heard above the constant din of the forest. To articulate, to speak, is to speak softly. Everyone knows that lum berjacks rarely talk. 24 Physiological, acoustic, and vocal substance are not the only things that undergo all these deterritorializations. The form of expression, as language, also crosses a threshold. *Vocal signs have temporal linearity, and it is this superlinearity *that con stitutes their specific deterritorialization and differentiates them from genetic linearity. Genetic linearity is above all spatial, even though its seg ments are constructed and reproduced in succession; thus at this level it does not require effective overcoding of any kind, only phenomena of end-to-end connection, local regulations, and partial interactions (overcoding takes place only at the level of integrations implying different orders of magnitude). That is why Jacob is reluctant to compare the genetic code to a language; in fact, the genetic code has neither emitter, receiver, comprehension, nor translation, only redundancies and surplus values. 25 The temporal linearity of language expression relates not only to a succession but to a formal synthesis of succession in which time constitutes a process of linear overcoding and engenders a phenomenon unknown on the other strata: *translation, *translatability, as opposed to the previous inductions and transductions. Translation should not be understood simply as the ability of one language to "represent" in some way the givens of another language, but beyond that as the ability of language, with its own givens on its own stratum, to represent all the other strata and thus achieve a scientific conception of the world. The scientific world *{Welt, *as opposed to the *Umwelt *of the animal) is the translation of all of the flows, particles, codes, and territorialities of the other strata into a sufficiently deterritorialized system of signs, in other words, into an overcoding specific to language. This property of  *overcoding *or *superlinearity *explains why, in language, not only is expression independent of content, but form of expression is independent of substance: translation is possible because the same form can pass from one substance to another, which is not the case for the genetic code, for example, between RNA and DNA chains. We will see later on how this situ ation gives rise to certain imperialist pretentions on behalf of language, which are naively expressed in such formulas as: "Every semiology of a nonlinguistic system must use the medium of language... .Language is the

1 0,000 B.C.: THE GEOLOGY OF MORALS D 63 interpreter of all the other systems, linguistic and nonlinguistic." This amounts to defining an abstract character of language and then saying that the other strata can share in that character only by being spoken in lan guage. That is stating the obvious. More positively, it must be noted that the immanence within language of universal translation means that its epistrata and parastrata, with respect to superpositions, diffusions, com munications, and abutments, operate in an entirely different manner than those of other strata: all human movements, even the most violent, imply translations. We have to hurry, Challenger said, we're being rushed by the line of time on this third stratum. So we have a new organization of content and expression, each with its own forms and substances: technological content, semiotic or symbolic expression. Content should be understood not sim ply as the hand and tools but as a technical social machine that preexists them and constitutes states of force or formations of power. Expression should be understood not simply as the face and language, or individual languages, but as a semiotic collective machine that preexists them and constitutes regimes of signs. A formation of power is much more than a tool; a regime of signs is much more than a language. Rather, they act as determining and selective agents, as much in the constitution of languages and tools as in their usages and mutual or respective diffusions and com munications. The third stratum sees the emergence of Machines that are fully a part of that stratum but at the same time rear up and stretch their pincers out in all directions at all the other strata. *Is this not like an interme-  diate state between the two states of the abstract Machine?*—the state in which it remains enveloped in a corresponding stratum (ecumenon), and the state in which it develops in its own right on the destratified plane of consistency (planomenon). The abstract machine begins to unfold, to stand to full height, producing an illusion exceeding all strata, even though the machine itself still belongs to a determinate stratum. This is, obviously, the illusion constitutive of man (who does man think he is?). This illusion derives from the overcoding immanent to language itself. But what is not illusory are the new distributions between content and expression: techno logical content characterized by the hand-tool relation and, at a deeper level, tied to a social Machine and formations of power; symbolic expres sion characterized by face-language relations and, at a deeper level, tied to a semiotic Machine and regimes of signs. On both sides, the epistrata and parastrata, the superposed degrees and abutting forms, attain more than ever before the status of autonomous strata in their own right. In cases where we can discern two different regimes of signs or two different forma tions of power, we shall say that they are in fact two different strata in human populations.

64 □ 10,000 B.C.: THE GEOLOGY OF MORALS What precisely is the relation now between content and expression, and what type of distinction is there between them? It's all in the head. Yet never was a distinction more real. What we are trying to say is that there is indeed one exterior milieu for the entire stratum, permeating the entire stratum: the cerebral-nervous milieu. It comes from the organic substra tum, but of course that substratum does not merely play the role of a sub stratum or passive support. It is no less complex in organization. Rather, it constitutes the prehuman soup immersing us. Our hands and faces are immersed in it. The brain is a population, a set of tribes tending toward two poles. In Leroi-Gourhan's analyses of the constitution of these two poles in the soup—one of which depends on the actions of the face, the other on the hand—their correlation or relativity does not preclude a real distinction between them; quite the contrary, it entails one, as the reciprocal presuppo sition of two articulations, the manual articulation of content and the facial articulation of expression. And the distinction is not simply real, as between molecules, things, or subjects; it has become *essential *(as they used to say in the Middle Ages), as between attributes, genres of being, or irreducible categories: things and words. Yet we find that the most general of movements, the one by which each of the distinct articulations is already double in its own right, carries over onto this level; certain formal elements of content play the role of expression in relation to content proper, and cer tain formal elements of expression play the role of content in relation to expression proper. In the first case, Leroi-Gourhan shows how the hand creates a whole world of symbols, a whole pluridimensional language, not to be confused with unilinear verbal language, which constitutes a radiat ing expression specific to content (he sees this as the origin of writing). 26 The second case is clearly displayed in the double articulation specific to language itself, since phonemes form a radiating content specific to the expression of monemes as linear significant segments (it is only under these conditions that double articulation as a general characteristic of strata has the linguistic meaning Martinet attributes to it). Our discussion of the relations between content and expression, the real distinction between them, and the variations of those relations and that distinction on the major types of strata, is now provisionally complete. Challenger wanted to go faster and faster. No one was left, but he went on anyway. The change in his voice, and in his appearance, was growing more and more pronounced. Something animalistic in him had begun to speak when he started talking about human beings. You still couldn't put your finger on it, but Challenger seemed to be deterritorializing on the spot. He still had three problems he wanted to discuss. The first seemed primarily terminological: Under what circumstances may we speak of signs? Should we say they are everywhere on all the strata and that there is a sign when

1 0,000 B.C.: THE GEOLOGY OF MORALS D 65 ever there is a form of expression? We may summarily distinguish three kinds of signs: *indexes (territorial signs), symbols (deterritorialized signs),  and icons (signs of reterritorialization). *Should we say that there are signs on all the strata, under the pretext that every stratum includes territoriali ties and movements of deterritorialization and reterritorialization? This kind of expansive method is very dangerous, because it lays the ground work for or reinforces the imperialism of language, if only by relying on its function as universal translator or interpreter. It is obvious that there is no system of signs common to all strata, not even in the form of a semiotic "chora" theoretically prior to symbolization. 27 It would appear that we may accurately speak of signs only when there is a distinction between forms of expression and forms of content that is not only real but also cate gorical. Under these conditions, there is a semiotic system on the corre sponding stratum because the abstract machine has precisely that fully erect posture that permits it to "write," in other words, to treat language and extract a *regime *of signs from it. But before it reaches that point, in so-called natural codings, the abstract machine remains enveloped in the strata: It does not write in any way and has no margin of latitude allowing it to recognize something as a sign (except in the strictly territorial sense of animal signs). After that point, the abstract machine develops on the plane of consistency and no longer has any way of making a categorical distinc tion between signs and particles; for example, it writes, but flush with the real, it inscribes directly upon the plane of consistency. It therefore seems reasonable to reserve the word "sign" in the strict sense for the last group of strata. This terminological discussion would be entirely without interest if it did not bring us to yet another danger: not the imperialism of language affecting all of the strata, but the imperialism of the signifier affecting lan guage itself, affecting all regimes of signs and the entire expanse of the strata upon which they are located. The question here is not whether there are signs on every stratum but whether all signs are signifiers, whether all signs are endowed with signifiance, whether the semiotic of signs is neces sarily linked to a semiology of the signifier. Those who take this route may even be led to forgo the notion of the sign, for the primacy of the signifier over language guarantees the primacy of language over all of the strata even more effectively than the simple expansion of the sign in all directions. What we are saying is that the illusion specific to *this *posture of the abstract Machine, the illusion that one can grasp and shuffle all the strata between one's pincers, can be better secured through the erection of the signifier than through the extension of the sign (thanks to signifiance, language can claim to be in direct contact with the strata without having to go through the supposed signs on each one). But we're still going in the same circle, we're still spreading the same canker.

6 6 □ 10,000 B.C.: THE GEOLOGY OF MORALS The linguistic relation between the signifier and signified has, of course, been conceived in many different ways. It has been said that they are arbitrary; that they are as necessary to each other as the two sides of the same leaf; that they correspond term by term, or else globally; and that they are so ambivalent as to be indistinguishable. In any event, the signified is thought not to exist outside of its relationship with signifier, and the ulti mate signified is the very existence of the signifier, extrapolated beyond the sign. There is only one thing that can be said about the signifier: it is Redun dancy, it is the Redundant. Hence its incredible despotism, and its success. Theories of arbitrariness, necessity, term-by-term or global correspon dence, and ambivalence serve the same cause: the reduction of expression to the signifier. Yet forms of content and forms of expression are highly relative, always in a state of reciprocal presupposition. The relations between their respective segments are biunivocal, exterior, and "de formed." There is never conformity between the two, or from one to the other. There is always real independence and a real distinction; even to fit the forms together, and to determine the relations between them, requires a specific, variable assemblage. None of these characteristics applies to the signifier-signified relation, even though some seem to coincide with it par tially and accidentally. Overall, these characteristics stand in radical oppo sition to the scenario of the signifier. A form of content is not a signified, any more than a form of expression is a signifier. 28 This is true for all the strata, including those on which language plays a role. Signifier enthusiasts take an oversimplified situation as their implicit model: word and thing. From the word they extract the signifier, and from the thing a signified in conformity with the word, and therefore subjugated to the signifier. They operate in a sphere interior to and homogeneous with language. Let us follow Foucault in his exemplary analysis, which, though it seems not to be, is eminently concerned with linguistics. Take a thing like the prison: the prison is a form, the "prison-form"; it is a form of content on a stratum and is related to other forms of content (school, barracks, hospi tal, factory). This thing or form does not refer back to the word "prison" but to entirely different words and concepts, such as "delinquent" and "delinquency," which express a new way of classifying, stating, translating, and even committing criminal acts. "Delinquency" is the form of expres sion in reciprocal presupposition with the form of content "prison." Delin quency is in no way a signifier, even a juridical signifier, the signified of which would be the prison. That would flatten the entire analysis. More over, the form of expression is reducible not to words but to a set of state ments arising in the social field considered as a stratum (that is what a regime of signs is). The form of content is reducible not to a thing but to a complex state of things as a formation of power (architecture, regimenta

1 0,000 B.C.: THE GEOLOGY OF MORALS □ 67 tion, etc.). We could say that there are two constantly intersecting multipli cities, "discursive multiplicities" of expression and "nondiscursive multi plicities" of content. It is even more complex than that because the prison as a form of content has a relative expression all its own; there are all kinds of statements specific to it that do not necessarily coincide with the state ments of delinquency. Conversely, delinquency as a form of expression has an autonomous content all its own, since delinquency expresses not only a new way of evaluating crimes but a new way of committing them. Form of content and form of expression, prison and delinquency: each has its own history, microhistory, segments. At most, along with other contents and expressions, they imply a shared state of the abstract Machine acting not at all as a signifier but as a kind of diagram (a single abstract machine for the prison and the school and the barracks and the hospital and the factory ...). Fitting the two types of forms together, segments of content and segments of expression, requires a whole double-pincered, or rather double-headed, concrete assemblage taking their real distinction into account. It requires a whole organization articulating formations of power and regimes of signs, and operating on the molecular level (societies char acterized by what Foucault calls disciplinary power). 29 In short, we should never oppose words to things that supposedly correspond to them, nor signifiers to signifieds that are supposedly in conformity with them. What should be opposed are distinct formalizations, in a state of unstable equi librium or reciprocal presupposition. "// *is in vain that we say what we see;  what we see never resides in what wesay."* *i0* * *As in school: there is not just one writing lesson, that of the great redundant Signifier for any and all signifieds. There are two distinct formalizations in reciprocal presupposi tion and constituting a double-pincer: the formalization of expression in the reading and writing lesson (with its own relative contents), and the formalization of content in the lesson of things (with their own relative expressions). We are never signifier or signified. We are stratified. The preferred method would be severely restrictive, as opposed to the expansive method that places signs on all strata or signifier in all signs (although at the limit it may forgo signs entirely). First, there exist forms of expression without signs (for example, the genetic code has nothing to do with a language). It is only under certain conditions that strata can be said to include signs; signs cannot be equated with language in general but are defined by regimes of statements that are so many real usages or functions of language. Then why retain the word *sign *for these regimes, which forma lize an expression without designating or signifying the simultaneous con tents, which are formalized in a different way? Signs are not signs of a thing; they are signs of deterritorialization and reterritorialization, they mark a certain threshold crossed in the course of these movements, and it is for

6 8 □ 10,000 B.C.: THE GEOLOGY OF MORALS this reason that the word should be retained (as we have seen, this applies even to animal "signs"). Next, if we consider regimes of signs using this restrictive definition, we see that they are not, or not necessarily, signifiers. Just as signs designate only a certain formalization of expression in a determinate group of strata, signifiance itself designates only one specific regime among a number of regimes existing in that particular formalization. Just as there are ase-miotic expressions, or expressions without signs, there are asemiological regimes of signs, asignifying signs, both on the strata and on the plane of consistency. The most that can be said of signifiance is that it characterizes *one *regime, which is not even the most interesting or modern or contemporary one, but is perhaps only more pernicious, cancerous, and despotic than the others, and more steeped in illusion than they. In any case, content and expression are never reducible to signified-signifier. And (this is the second problem) neither are they reducible to base-superstructure. One can no more posit a primacy of content as the determining factor than a primacy of expression as a signifying system. Expression can never be made into a form reflecting content, even if one endows it with a "certain" amount of independence and a certain potential for reacting, if only because so-called economic content already has a form and even forms of expression that are specific to it. Form of content and form of expression involve two parallel formalizations in presupposition: it is obvious that their segments constantly intertwine, embed themselves in one another; but this is accomplished by the abstract machine from which the two forms derive, and by machinic assemblages that regulate their relations. If this parallelism is replaced by a pyramidal image, then content (including its form) becomes an economic base of production displaying all of the characteristics of the Abstract; the assemblages become the first story of a superstructure that, as such, is necessarily situated within a State apparatus; the regimes of signs and forms of expression become the second story of the superstructure, defined by ideology. It isn't altogether clear where language should go, since the great Despot decided that it should be reserved a special place, as the common good of the nation and the vehicle for information. Thus one misconstrues the nature of language, which exists only in heterogeneous regimes of signs, and rather than circulating information distributes contradictory orders. It misconstrues the nature of regimes of signs, which express organizations of power or assemblages and have nothing to do with ideology as the supposed expres sion of a content (ideology is a most execrable concept obscuring all of the effectively operating social machines). It misconstrues the nature of orga nizations of power, which are in no way located within a State apparatus but rather are everywhere, effecting formalizations of content and expres

Finally, it misconstrues the  nature of content, which is in no way economic "in the last instance," since  there are as many directly economic signs or expressions as there are  noneconomic contents. Nor can the status of social formations be analyzed  by throwing some signifier into the base, or vice versa, or a bit of phallus or  castration into political economy, or a bit of economics or politics into  psychoanalysis. There is a third problem. It is difficult to elucidate the system of the strata without seeming to introduce a kind of cosmic or even spiritual evo-  lution from one to the other, as if they were arranged in stages and ascended  degrees of perfection. Nothing of the sort. The different figures of content  and expression are not stages. There is no biosphere or noosphere, but  everywhere the same Mechanosphere. If one begins by considering the  strata in themselves, it cannot be said that one is less organized than  another. This even applies to a stratum serving as a substratum: there is no  fixed order, and one stratum can serve directly as a substratum for another  without the intermediaries one would expect there to be from the stand-  point of stages and degrees (for example, microphysical sectors can serve as  an immediate substratum for organic phenomena). Or the apparent order  can be reversed, with cultural or technical phenomena providing a fertile  soil, a good soup, for the development of insects, bacteria, germs, or even  particles. The industrial age defined as the age of insects ... It's even worse  nowadays: you can't even tell in advance which stratum is going to commu-  nicate with which other, or in what direction. Above all, there is no lesser,  no higher or lower, organization; the substratum is an integral part of the  stratum, is bound up with it as the milieu in which change occurs, and not  an increase in organization. 31 Furthermore, if we consider the plane of con sistency we note that the most disparate of things and signs move upon it: a  semiotic fragment rubs shoulders with a chemical interaction, an electron  crashes into a language, a black hole captures a genetic message, a crystalli-  zation produces a passion, the wasp and the orchid cross a letter... There  is no "like" here, we are not saying "like an electron," "like an interaction,"  etc. The plane of consistency is the abolition of all metaphor; all that con-  sists is Real. These are electrons in person, veritable black holes, actual  organites, authentic sign sequences. It's just that they have been uprooted  from their strata, destratified, decoded, deterritorialized, and that is what  makes their proximity and interpenetration in the plane of consistency  possible. A silent dance. *The plane of consistency knows nothing of differ-  ences in level, orders of magnitude, or distances. It knows nothing of the dif-  ference between the artificial and the natural.

But how can one still identify and name things if they have lost the strata that qualified them, if they have gone into absolute deterritorialization? Eyes are black holes, but what are black holes and eyes outside their strata and territorialities? What it comes down to is that we cannot content our selves with a dualism or summary opposition between the strata and the destratified plane of consistency. The strata themselves are animated and defined by relative speeds of deterritorialization; moreover, absolute deterritorialization is there from the beginning, and the strata are spin offs, thickenings on a plane of consistency that is everywhere, always pri mary and always immanent. In addition, the plane of consistency is occupied, drawn by the abstract Machine; the abstract Machine exists  *simultaneously *developed on the destratified plane it draws, and envel oped in each stratum whose unity of composition it defines, and even half-erected in certain strata whose form of prehension it defines. That which races or dances upon the plane of consistency thus carries with it the aura of its stratum, an undulation, a memory or tension. The plane of consistency retains just enough of the strata to extract from them variables that operate in the plane of consistency as its own functions. The plane of consistency, or planomenon, is in no way an undifferentiated aggregate of unformed matters, but neither is it a chaos of formed matters of every kind. It is true that on the plane of consistency there are no longer forms or substances, content or expression, respective and relative deterritorializations. But beneath the forms and substances of the strata the plane of consistency (or the abstract machine) *constructs continuums  of intensity: *it creates continuity for intensities that it extracts from distinct forms and substances. Beneath contents and expressions the plane of consistency (or the abstract machine) *emits and combines  particles-signs *that set the most asignifying of signs to functioning in the most deterritorialized of particles. Beneath relative movements the plane of consistency (or the abstract machine) *performs conjunctions of flows of  deterritorialization *that transform the respective indexes into absolute values. The only intensities known to the strata are discontinuous, bound up in forms and substances; the only particles are divided into particles of content and articles of expression; the only deterritorialized flows are disjointed and reterritorialized. Continuum of intensities, combined emission of particles or signs-particles, conjunction of deterritorialized flows: these are the three factors proper to the plane of consistency; they are brought about by the abstract machine and are constitutive of destratification. Now there is no hint in all of this of a chaotic white night or an undifferentiated black night. There are rules, rules of "plan(n)ing," of diagramming, as we will see later on, or elsewhere. The

1 0,000 B.C.: THE GEOLOGY OF MORALS □ 71 abstract machine is not random; the continuities, emissions and combina tions, and conjunctions do not occur in just any fashion. A final distinction must now be noted. Not only does the abstract machine have different simultaneous states accounting for the complex ity of what takes place on the plane of consistency, but the abstract machine should not be confused with what we call a concrete machinic assemblage. The *abstract machine *sometimes develops upon the plane of consistency, whose continuums, emissions, and conjugations it con structs, and sometimes remains enveloped in a stratum whose unity of composition and force of attraction or prehension it defines. The  *machinic assemblage *is something entirely different from the abstract machine, even though it is very closely connected with it. First, on a stra tum, it performs the coadaptations of content and expression, ensures biunivocal relationships between segments of content and segments of expression, and guides the division of the stratum into epistrata and parastrata. Next, between strata, it ensures the relation to whatever serves as a substratum and brings about the corresponding changes in organization. Finally, it is in touch with the plane of consistency because it necessarily effectuates the abstract machine on a particular stratum, between strata, and in the relation between the strata and the plane. An assemblage (for example, the smith's anvil among the Dogons) is neces sary for the articulations of the organic stratum to come about. An assem blage is necessary for the relation between two strata to come about. And an assemblage is necessary for organisms to be caught within and perme ated by a social field that utilizes them: Must not the Amazons amputate a breast to adapt the organic stratum to a warlike technological stratum, as though at the behest of a fearsome woman-bow-steppe assemblage? Assemblages are necessary for states offeree and regimes of signs to inter twine their relations. Assemblages are necessary in order for the unity of composition enveloped in a stratum, the relations between a given stra tum and the others, and the relation between these strata and the plane of consistency to be organized rather than random. In every respect, machinic assemblages *effectuate *the abstract machine insofar as it is developed on the plane of consistency or enveloped in a stratum. The most important problem of all: given a certain machinic assemblage, what is its relation of effectuation with the abstract machine? How does it effectuate it, with what adequation? Classify assemblages. What we call the mechanosphere is the set of all abstract machines and machinic assemblages outside the strata, on the strata, or between strata. The system of the strata thus has nothing to do with signifier and signi fied, base and superstructure, mind and matter. All of these are ways of reducing the strata to a single stratum, or of closing the system in on itself

7 2 □ 10,000 B.C.: THE GEOLOGY OF MORALS by cutting it off from the plane of consistency as destratification. We had to summarize before we lost our voice. Challenger was finishing up. His voice had become unbearably shrill. He was suffocating. His hands were becom ing elongated pincers that had become incapable of grasping anything but could still vaguely point to things. Some kind of matter seemed to be pour ing out from the double mask, the two heads; it was impossible to tell whether it was getting thicker or more watery. Some of the audience had returned, but only shadows and prowlers. "You hear that? It's an animal's voice." So the summary would have to be quick, the terminology would have to be set down as well as possible, for no good reason. There was a first group of notions: the Body without Organs or the destratified Plane of Consistency; the Matter of the Plane, that which occurs on the body or plane (singular, nonsegmented multiplicities composed of intensive con tinuums, emissions of particles-signs, conjunctions of flows); and the abstract Machine, or abstract Machines, insofar as they construct that body or draw that plane or "diagram" what occurs (lines of flight, or abso lute deterritorializations). Then there was the system of the strata. On the intensive continuum, the strata fashion forms and form matters into substances. In combined emis sions, they make the distinction between expressions and contents, units of expression and units of content, for example, signs and particles. In con junctions, they separate flows, assigning them relative movements and diverse territorialities, relative deterritorializations and complementary reterritorializations. Thus the strata set up everywhere double articula tions animated by movements: forms and substances of content and forms and substances of expression constituting segmentary multiplicities with relations that are determinable in every case. Such are the *strata. *Each stra tum is a double articulation of content and expression, both of which are really distinct and in a state of reciprocal presupposition. Content and expression intermingle, and it is two-headed machinic assemblages that place their segments in relation. What varies from stratum to stratum is the nature of the real distinction between content and expression, the nature of the substances as formed matters, and the nature of the relative move ments. We may make a summary distinction between three major types of real distinction: the real-formal distinction between orders of magnitude, with the establishment of a resonance of expression (induction); the real-real distinction between different subjects, with the establishment of a linearity of expression (transduction); and the real-essential distinction between different attributes or categories, with the establishment of a superlinearity of expression (translation). Each stratum serves as the substratum for another stratum. Each stra tum has a unity of composition defined by its milieu, substantial elements,

But it divides into *parastrata *according to its irreducible forms and associated milieus, and into *epistrata *according to its layers of formed substances and intermediary milieus. Epistrata and parastrata must themselves be thought of as strata. A machinic assemblage is an *interstratum *insofar as it regulates the relations between strata, as well as the relations between contents and expressions on each stratum, in conformity with the preceding divisions. A single assemblage can borrow from different strata, and with a certain amount of apparent disorder; conversely, a stratum or element of a stratum can join others in function ing in a different assemblage. Finally, the machinic assemblage is a  *metastratum *because it is also in touch with the plane of consistency and necessarily effectuates the abstract machine. The abstract machine exists enveloped in each stratum, whose Ecumenon or unity of composition it defines, and developed on the plane of consistency, whose destratification it performs (the Planomenon). Thus when the assemblages fit together the variables of a stratum as a function of its unity, they also bring about a spe cific effectuation of the abstract machine as it exists outside the strata. Machinic assemblages are simultaneously located at the intersection of the contents and expression on each stratum, and at the intersection of all of the strata with the plane of consistency. They rotate in all directions, like beacons. It was over. Only later on would all of this take on concrete meaning. The double-articulated mask had come undone, and so had the gloves and the tunic, from which liquids escaped. As they streamed away they seemed to eat at the strata of the lecture hall, which was filled with fumes of olibanum and "hung with strangely figured arras." Disarticulated, deterritorialized, Challenger muttered that he was taking the earth with him, that he was leaving for the mysterious world, his poison garden. He whispered some thing else: it is by headlong flight that things progress and signs proliferate. Panic is creation. A young woman cried out, her face "convulsed with a wilder, deeper, and more hideous epilepsy of stark panic than they had seen on human countenance before." No one had heard the summary, and no one tried to keep Challenger from leaving. Challenger, or what remained of him, slowly hurried toward the *plane of consistency, *following a bizarre tra jectory with nothing relative left about it. He tried to slip into an assem blage serving as a drum-gate, the particle Clock with its intensive clicking and conjugated rhythms hammering out the absolute: "The figure slumped oddly into a posture scarcely human, and began a curious, fascinated sort of shuffle toward the coffin-shaped clock *** The figure had now reached the abnormal clock, and the watchers saw through the dense fumes a blurred black claw fumbling with the tall, hieroglyphed door.

7 6 □ NOVEMBER 20, 1923: POSTULATES OF LINGUISTICS grammar (masculine-feminine, singular-plural, noun-verb, subject of the statement-subject of enunciation, etc.). The elementary unit of language— the statement—is the order-word. 1 Rather than common sense, a faculty for the centralization of information, we must define an abominable faculty consisting in emitting, receiving, and transmitting order-words. Language is made not to be believed but to be obeyed, and to compel obedi ence. "The baroness has not the slightest intention of convincing me of her sincerity; she is simply indicating that she prefers to see me pretend to agree." 2 We see this in police or government announcements, which often have little plausibility or truthfulness, but say very clearly what should be observed and retained. The indifference to any kind of credibility exhib ited by these announcements often verges on provocation. This is proof that the issue lies elsewhere. Let people say...: that is all language demands. Spengler notes that the fundamental forms of speech are not the statement of a judgment or the expression of a feeling, but "the command, the expression of obedience, the assertion, the question, the affirmation or negation," very short phrases that command life and are inseparable from enterprises and large-scale projects: "Ready?" "Yes." "Go ahead." 3 Words are not tools, but we give children language, pens, and notebooks as we give workers shovels and pickaxes. A rule of grammar is a power marker before it is a syntactical marker. The order does not refer to prior significations or to a prior organization of distinctive units. Quite the opposite. Informa tion is only the strict minimum necessary for the emission, transmission, and observation of orders as commands. One must be just informed enough not to confuse "Fire!" with "Fore!" or to avoid the unfortunate situ ation of the teacher and the student as described by Lewis Carroll (the teacher, at the top of the stairs, asks a question that is passed on by servants, who distort it at each step of the way, and the student, below in the court yard, returns an answer that is also distorted at each stage of the trip back). Language is not life; it gives life orders. Life does not speak; it listens and waits. 4 Every order-word, even a father's to his son, carries a little death sentence—a Judgment, as Kafka put it. The hard part is to specify the status and scope of the order-word. It is not a question of the origin of language, since the order-word is only a language-function, a function coextensive with language. If language always seems to presuppose itself, if we cannot assign it a nonlinguistic point of departure, it is because language does not operate between some thing seen (or felt) and something said, but always goes from saying to say ing. We believe that narrative consists not in communicating what one has seen but in transmitting what one has heard, what someone else said to you. Hearsay. It does not even suffice to invoke a vision distorted by pas sion. The "first" language, or rather the first determination of language, is

NOVEMBER 20, 1923: POSTULATES OF LINGUISTICS □ 77 not the trope or metaphor but *indirect discourse. *The importance some have accorded metaphor and metonymy proves disastrous for the study of language. Metaphors and metonymies are merely effects; they are a part of language only when they presuppose indirect discourse. There are many passions in a passion, all manner of voices in a voice, murmurings, speak ing in tongues: that is why all discourse is indirect, and the translative movement proper to language is that of indirect discourse. 5 Benveniste denies that the bee has language, even though it has an organic coding pro cess and *even uses tropes. *It has no language because it can communicate what it has seen but not transmit what has been communicated to it. A bee that has seen a food source can communicate the message to bees that did not see it, but a bee that has not seen it cannot transmit the message to oth ers that did not see it. 6 Language is not content to go from a first party to a second party, from one who has seen to one who has not, but necessarily goes from a second party to a third party, neither of whom has seen. It is in this sense that language is the transmission of the word as order-word, not the communication of a sign as information. Language is a map, not a trac ing. But how can the order-word be a function coextensive with language when the order, the command, seems tied to a restricted type of explicit proposition marked by the imperative? Austin's famous theses clearly demonstrate that the various extrinsic relations between action and speech by which a statement can describe an action in an indicative mode or incite it in an imperative mode, etc., are not all there is. There are also intrinsic relations between speech and certain actions that are accomplished by *sayingthem *(the performative: I swear by saying "I swear"), and more generally between speech and certain actions that are accomplished in speaking (the illocutionary: I ask a question by saying "Is ... ?" I make a promise by saying "I love you ..."; I give a com mand by using the imperative, etc.). These acts internal to speech, these immanent relations between statements and acts, have been termed  *implicit or nondiscursive presuppositions, *as opposed to the potentially explicit assumptions by which a statement refers to other statements or an external action (Ducrot). The theory of the performative sphere, and the broader sphere of the illocutionary, has had three important and immedi ate consequences: (1) It has made it impossible to conceive of language as a code, since a code is the condition of possibility for all explanation. It has also made it impossible to conceive of speech as the communication of information: to order, question, promise, or affirm is not to inform some one about a command, doubt, engagement, or assertion but to effectuate these specific, immanent, and necessarily implicit acts. (2) It has made it impossible to define semantics, syntactics, or even phonematics as scien tific zones of language independent *of pragmatics. *Pragmatics ceases to be

7 8 □ NOVEMBER 20, 1923: POSTULATES OF LINGUISTICS a "trash heap," pragmatic determinations cease to be subject to the alterna-  tive: fall outside language, or answer to explicit conditions that syntacticize  and semanticize pragmatic determinations. Instead, pragmatics becomes  the presupposition behind all of the other dimensions and insinuates itself  into everything. (3) It makes it impossible to maintain the distinction  between language and speech because speech can no longer be defined sim-  ply as the extrinsic and individual use of a primary signification, or the var-  iable application of a preexisting syntax. Quite the opposite, the meaning  and syntax of language can no longer be defined independently of the  speech acts they presuppose. 7 It is true that it is still difficult to see how speech acts or implicit presup positions can be considered a function coextensive with language. It is all  the more difficult if one starts with the performative (that which one does  by saying it) and moves by extension to the illocutionary (that which one  does in speaking). For it is always possible to thwart that move. The  performative can be walled in by explaining it by specific syntactic and  semantic characteristics avoiding any recourse to a generalized prag-  matics. According to Benveniste, for example, the performative relates not  to acts but instead to a property of*self-referentiality *of terms (the true per-  sonal pronouns, I, YOU..., defined as shifters). By this account, a  preexistent structure of subjectivity, or intersubjectivity, in language,  rather than presupposing speech acts, is adequate to account for them. 8 Benveniste thus defines language as communicational rather than infor-  mational; this properly linguistic intersubjectivity, or subjectification,  explains all the rest, in other words, everything that is brought into being by  saying it. The question is whether subjective communication is any better a  linguistic notion than ideal information. Oswald Ducrot has set forth the  reasons that have led him to reverse Benveniste's schema: The phenome-  non of self-referentiality cannot account for the performative. The oppo-  site is the case; it is "the fact that certain statements are socially devoted to  the accomplishment of certain actions" that explains self-referentiality.  The performative itself is explained by the illocutionary, not the opposite.  It is the illocutionary that constitutes the nondiscursive or implicit presup-  positions. And the illocutionary is in turn explained by collective assem-  blages of enunciation, by juridical acts or equivalents of juridical acts,  which, far from depending on subjectification proceedings or assignations  of subjects in language, in fact determine their distribution. Communica-  tion is no better a concept than information; intersubjectivity gets us no  further than signifiance in accounting for these "statements-acts" assem-  blages that in each language delimit the role and range of subjective mor-  phemes. 9 (We will see that the analysis of indirect discourse confirms this

We call *order-words, *not a particular category of explicit statements (for example, in the imperative), but the relation of every word or every state ment to implicit presuppositions, in other words, to speech acts that are, and can only be, accomplished in the statement. Order-words do not con cern commands only, but every act that is linked to statements by a "social obligation." Every statement displays this link, directly or indirectly. Ques tions, promises, are order-words. The only possible definition of language is the set of all order-words, implicit presuppositions, or speech acts cur rent in a language at a given moment. The relation between the statement and the act is internal, immanent, but it is not one of identity. Rather, it is a relation *of redundancy. *The order-word itself is the redundancy of the act and the statement. Newspapers, news, proceed by redundancy, in that they tell us what we "must" think, retain, expect, etc. Language is neither informational nor communica-tional. It is not the communication of information but something quite different: the transmission of order-words, either from one statement to another or within each statement, insofar as each statement accomplishes an act and the act is accomplished in the statement. The most general schema of information science posits in principle an ideal state of maximum information and makes redundancy merely a limitative condition serving to decrease this theoretical maximum in order to prevent it from being drowned out by noise. We are saying that the redundancy of the order-word is instead primary and that information is only the minimal condition for the transmission of order-words (which is why the opposition to be made is not between noise and information but between all the indisciplines at work in language, and the order-word as discipline or "grammaticality"). Redundancy has two forms, *frequency *and *resonance; *the first concerns the signifiance of information, the second (I = I) concerns the subjectivity of communication. It becomes apparent that information and communication, and even signifiance and subjectification, are subordinate to redundancy. A distinction is sometimes made between information and communication; some authors envision an abstract signifiance of information and an abstract subjectification of communication. None of this, however, yields an implicit or primary form of language. There is no signifiance independent of dominant significations, nor is there subjectification independent of an established order of subjection. Both depend on the nature and transmission of order-words in a given social field. There is no individual enunciation. There is not even a subject of enun ciation. Yet relatively few linguists have analyzed the necessarily social

The social character of enuncia tion is intrinsically founded only if one succeeds in demonstrating how enunciation in itself implies *collective assemblages. *It then becomes clear that the statement is individuated, and enunciation subjectified, only to the extent that an impersonal collective assemblage requires it and deter mines it to be so. It is for this reason that indirect discourse, *especially  "free" indirect discourse, *is of exemplary value: there are no clear, distinc tive contours; what comes first is not an insertion of variously individ uated statements, or an interlocking of different subjects of enunciation, but a collective assemblage resulting in the determination of relative subjectification proceedings, or assignations of individuality and their shifting distributions within discourse. Indirect discourse is not explained by the distinction between subjects; rather, it is the assemblage, as it freely appears in this discourse, that explains all the voices present within a single voice, the glimmer of girls in a monologue by Charlus, the languages in a language, the order-words in a word. The American murderer "Son of Sam" killed on the prompting of an ancestral voice, itself transmitted through the voice of a dog. The notion of collective assemblage of enuncia tion takes on primary importance since it is what must account for the social character. We can no doubt define the collective assemblage as the redundant complex of the act and the statement that necessarily accom plishes it. But this is still only a nominal definition; it does not even enable us to justify our previous position that redundancy is irreducible to a sim ple identity (or that there is no simple identity between the statement and the act). If we wish to move to a real definition of the collective assemblage, we must ask of what consist these acts immanent to language that are in redundancy with statements or constitute order-words. These acts seem to be defined as the set of all *incorporeal transforma-* *tions *current in a given society and *attributed to *the bodies of that society. We may take the word "body" in its broadest sense (there are mental bod ies, souls are bodies, etc.). We must, however, distinguish between the actions and passions affecting those bodies, and acts, which are only noncorporeal attributes or the "expressed" of a statement. When Ducrot asks what an act consists of, he turns precisely to the juridical assemblage, taking the example of the judge's sentence that transforms the accused into a convict. In effect, what takes place beforehand (the crime of which some one is accused), and what takes place after (the carrying out of the penalty), are actions-passions affecting bodies (the body of the property, the body of the victim, the body of the convict, the body of the prison); but the transfor mation of the accused into a convict is a pure instantaneous act or incorpo

Bodies have an age, they mature and grow old; but majority, retirement, any given age category, are incorporeal trans formations that are immediately attributed to bodies in particular socie ties. "You are no longer a child": this statement concerns an incorporeal transformation, even if it applies to bodies and inserts itself into their actions and passions. The incorporeal transformation is recognizable by its instantaneousness, its immediacy, by the simultaneity of the statement expressing the transformation and the effect the transformation produces; that is why order-words are precisely dated, to the hour, minute, and sec ond, and take effect the moment they are dated. Love is an intermingling of bodies that can be represented by a heart with an arrow through it, by a union of souls, etc., but the declaration "I love you" expresses a noncor-poreal attribute of bodies, the lover's as well as that of the loved one. Eating bread and drinking wine are interminglings of bodies; communing with Christ is also an intermingling of bodies, properly spiritual bodies that are no less "real" for being spiritual. But the transformation of the body of the bread and the wine into the body and blood of Christ is the pure expressed of a statement attributed to the bodies. In an airplane hijacking, the threat of a hijacker brandishing a revolver is obviously an action; so is the execution of the hostages, if it occurs. But the transformation of the passengers into hostages, and of the plane-body into a prison-body, is an instantaneous incorporeal transformation, a "mass media act" in the sense in which the English speak of "speech acts." The order-words or assemblages of enunciation in a given society (in short, the illocutionary) designate this instantaneous relation between statements and the incorporeal transformations or noncorporeal attributes they express. The instantaneousness of the order-word, which can be projected to infinity, placed at the origin of society, is quite strange; for Rousseau, for example, the passage from the state of nature to the social state is like a leap in place, an incorporeal transformation occurring at zero hour. Real his tory undoubtedly recounts the actions and passions of the bodies that develop in a social field; it communicates them in a certain fashion; but it also transmits order-words, in other words, pure acts intercalated into that development. History will never be rid of dates. Perhaps economics or financial analysis best demonstrates the presence and instantaneousness of these decisive acts in an overall process (that is why statements defi nitely do not belong to ideology, but are already at work in what is suppos edly the domain of the economic base). The galloping inflation in Germany after 1918 was a crisis affecting the monetary body, and many

First, the circumstances must be taken into account: Benveniste clearly demonstrates that a performative statement is nothing outside of the circumstances that make it performative. Anybody can shout, "I declare a general mobilization," but in the absence of an effec tuated variable giving that person the right to make such a statement it is an act of peurility or insanity, not an act of enunciation. This is also true of "I love you," which has neither meaning nor subject nor addressee outside of circumstances that not only give it credibility but make it a veritable assemblage, a power marker, even in the case of an unhappy love (it is still by a will to power that one obeys...). The general term "circumstances" should not leave the impression that it is a question only of external cir cumstances. "I swear" is not the same when said in the family, at school, in a love affair, in a secret society, or in court: it is not the same thing, and nei ther is it the same statement; it is not the same bodily situation, and neither is it the same incorporeal transformation. The transformation applies to bodies but is itself incorporeal, internal to enunciation. There are variables of expression *that establish a relation between language and the outside, but  precisely because they are immanent to language. *As long as linguistics confines itself to constants, whether syntactical, morphological, or pho nological, it ties the statement to a signifier and enunciation to a subject and accordingly botches the assemblage; it consigns circumstances to the exterior, closes language in on itself, and makes pragmatics a residue. Prag matics, on the other hand, does not simply appeal to external circum stances: it brings to light variables of expression or of enunciation that are so many internal reasons for language not to close itself off. As Volosinov [Bakhtin] says, as long as linguistics extracts constants, it is incapable of help ing us understand how a single word can be a complete enunciation; there must be "an extra something" that "remains outside of the scope of the entire set of linguistic categories and definitions," even though it is still entirely within the purview of the theory of enunciation or language.' 3 The order-word is precisely that variable that makes the word as such an enunciation. The instantaneousness of the order-word, its immediacy, gives it a power of varia tion in relation to the bodies to which the transformation is attributed. Pragmatics is a politics of language. A study such as Jean-Pierre Faye's on the constitution of Nazi statements in the German social field is in this respect exemplary (and cannot be directly transferred to the constitution of Fascist statements in Italy). Transformational research of this kind is

We may take as another example, under different conditions, the formation of a prop erly Leninist type of statement in Soviet Russia, basing ourselves on a text by Lenin entitled "On Slogans" (1917). This text constituted an incorpo real transformation that extracted from the masses a proletarian class as an assemblage of enunciation *before *the conditions were present for the prole tariat to exist as a body. A stroke of genius from the First Marxist Interna tional, which "invented" a new type of class: Workers of the world, unite! 14 Taking advantage of the break with the Social Democrats, Lenin invented or decreed yet another incorporeal transformation that extracted from the proletarian class a vanguard as an assemblage of enunciation and was attributed to the "Party," a new type of party as a distinct body, at the risk of falling into a properly bureaucratic system of redundancy. The Leninist wager, an act of audacity? Lenin declared that the slogan *{mot d'ordre) *"All power to the Soviets" was valid only from the 27th of February to the 4th of July for the peacetime development of the Revolution, and no longer held in the state of war; the passage from peace to war implied this transforma tion, not just from the masses to a guiding proletariat, but from the prole tariat to a directing vanguard. *July 4 exactly *the power of the Soviets came to an end. All of the external circumstances can be assigned: the war as well as the insurrection that forced Lenin to flee to Finland. But the fact remains that the incorporeal transformation was uttered on the 4th of July, prior to the organization of the body to which it would be attributed, namely, the Party itself. "Every particular slogan must be deduced from the totality of the specific features of a definite political situation." 15 If the objection is leveled that these specific features pertain to politics and not linguistics, it must be observed how thoroughly politics works language from within, causing not only the vocabulary but also the structure and all of the phrasal elements to vary as the order-words change. A type of state ment can be evaluated only as a function of its pragmatic implications, in other words, in relation to the implicit presuppositions, immanent acts, or incorporeal transformations it expresses and which introduce new config urations of bodies. True intuition is not a judgment of grammaticality but an evaluation of internal variables of enunciation in relation to the aggre gate of the circumstances. We have gone from explicit commands to order-words as implicit pre suppositions; from order-words to the immanent acts or incorporeal trans formations they express; and from there to the assemblages of enunciation whose variables they are. To the extent these variables enter at a given moment into determinable relations, the assemblages combine in *a regime  of signs or a semiotic machine. *It is obvious that a society is plied by several

Moreover, at a later time there will arise new order-words that will modify the variables and will not yet be part of a known regime. Thus the order-word is redundancy in several ways: as a function of the process of transmission essential to it, and in itself, from the time it is emitted, in its "immediate" relation with the act or transformation it effectuates. The order-word is already redundancy even when it is in rupture with a particular semiotic. That is why every state ment of a collective assemblage of enunciation belongs to indirect dis course. Indirect discourse is the presence of a reported statement within the reporting statement, the presence of an order-word within the word. Language in its entirety is indirect discourse. Indirect discourse in no way supposes direct discourse; rather, the latter is extracted from the former, to the extent that the operations of signifiance and proceedings of subjec-tification in an assemblage are distributed, attributed, and assigned, or that the variables of the assemblage enter into constant relations, however temporarily. Direct discourse is a detached fragment of a mass and is born of the dismemberment of the collective assemblage; but the collective assemblage is always like the murmur from which I take my proper name, the constellation of voices, concordant or not, from which I draw my voice. I always depend on a molecular assemblage of enunciation that is not given in my conscious mind, any more than it depends solely on my apparent social determinations, which combine many heterogeneous regimes of signs. Speaking in tongues. To write is perhaps to bring this assemblage of the unconscious to the light of day, to select the whispering voices, to gather the tribes and secret idioms from which I extract something I call my Self *(Moi). I *is an order-word. A schizophrenic said: "I heard voices say: *he is conscious of life."* *16* * *In this sense, there is indeed a schizophrenic cogito, but it is a cogito that makes self-consciousness the incorporeal transformation of an order-word, or a result of indirect discourse. My direct discourse is still the free indirect discourse running through me, coming from other worlds or other planets. That is why so many artists and writers have been tempted by the seance table. When we ask what faculty is specific to the order-word, we must indeed attribute to it some strange characteristics: a kind of instantaneousness in the emission, perception, and transmission of order-words; a wide variability, and a power of forgetting permitting one to feel absolved of the order-words one has followed and then abandoned in order to welcome others; a properly ideal or ghostly capacity for the appre hension of incorporeal transformations; an aptitude for grasping language as an immense indirect discourse.' 7 The faculty of the cuer and the cued, of the song that always holds a tune within a tune in a relation of redundancy; a faculty that is in truth mediumistic, glossolalic, or xenoglossic.

But they effectuate its condition of possibility *{the superlinearity of expres-  sion), *they fulfill in each instance this condition of possibility; without them, language would remain a pure virtuality (the superlinear character of indirect discourse). Doubtless, the assemblages vary, undergo transfor mation. But they do not necessarily vary by language, they do not corre spond to the various languages. A language seems to be defined by the syntactical, semantic, phonological constants in its statements; the collec tive assemblage, on the contrary, concerns the usage of these constants in relation to variables internal to enunciation itself (variables of expression, immanent acts, or incorporeal transformations). Different constants, dif ferent languages, may have the same usage; the same constants in a given language may have different usages, successively or even simultaneously. We cannot content ourselves with a duality between constants as linguistic factors that are explicit or potentially explicit, and variables as extrinsic, nonlinguistic factors. For the pragmatic variables of usage are internal to enunciation and constitute the implicit presuppositions of language. Thus if the collective assemblage is in each instance coextensive with the linguis tic system considered, and to language as a whole, it is because it expresses the set of incorporeal transformations that effectuate the condition of pos sibility of language and utilize the elements of the linguistic system. The language-function thus defined is neither informational nor communi-cational; it has to do neither with signifying information nor with intersubjective communication. And it is useless to abstract a signifiance outside information, or a subjectivity outside communication. For the subjectification proceedings and movement of signifiance relate to regimes of signs, or collective assemblages. The language-function is the transmission of order-words, and order-words relate to assemblages, just as assemblages relate to the incorporeal transformations constituting the variables of the function. Linguistics is nothing without a pragmatics (semiotic or political) to define the effectuation of the *condition of possibil-  ity *of language and the *usage *of linguistic elements. **II. "There Is an Abstract Machine of Language That ** **Does Not Appeal to Any 'Extrinsic' Factor"** If in a social field we distinguish the set of corporeal modifications and the set of incorporeal transformations, we are presented, despite the variety in each of the sets, with two formalizations, one of *content, *the other of  *expression. *For content is not opposed to form but has its own formal ization: the hand-tool pole, or the lesson of things.

0 86 □ NOVEMBER 20, 1923: POSTULATES OF LINGUISTICS to expression, inasmuch as expression also has its own formalization: the face-language pole, the lesson of signs. Precisely because content, like expression, has a form of its own, one can never assign the form of expres sion the function of simply representing, describing, or averring a corre sponding content: there is neither correspondence nor conformity. The two formalizations are not of the same nature; they are independent, heter ogeneous. The Stoics were the first to theorize this independence: they dis tinguished between the actions and passions of bodies (using the word "body" in the broadest sense, as applying to any formed content) and incorporeal acts (the "expressed" of the statements). The form of expres sion is constituted by the warp of expresseds, and the form of content by the woof of bodies. When knife cuts flesh, when food or poison spreads through the body, when a drop of wine falls into water, there is an *intermin-  gling of bodies; *but the statements, "The knife is cutting the flesh," "I am eating," "The water is turning red," express *incorporeal transformations *of an entirely different nature (events). 18 The genius of the Stoics was to have taken this paradox as far as it could go, up to the point of insanity and cyni cism, and to have grounded it in the most serious of principles: their reward was to be the first to develop a philosophy of language. The paradox gets us nowhere unless, like the Stoics, we add that incorpo real transformations, incorporeal attributes, apply to bodies, and only to bodies. They are the expressed of statements but are *attributed *to bodies. The purpose is not to describe or represent bodies; bodies already have proper qualities, actions and passions, souls, in short forms, which are themselves bodies. Representations are bodies too! If noncorporeal attri butes apply to bodies, if there are good grounds for making a distinction between the incorporeal expressed "to become red" and the corporeal quality "red," etc., it has nothing to with representation. We cannot even say that the body or state of things is the "referent" of the sign. In expressing the noncorporeal attribute, and by that token attributing it to the body, one is not representing or referring but *intervening *in a way; it is a speech act. The independence of the two kinds of forms, forms of expression and forms of content, is not contradicted but confirmed by the fact that the expressions or expresseds are inserted into or intervene in contents, not to represent them but to anticipate them or move them back, slow them down or speed them up, separate or combine them, delimit them in a different way. The warp of the instantaneous transformations is always inserted into the woof of the continuous modifications. (Hence the significance of dates for the Stoics. From what moment can it be said that someone is bald? In what sense does a statement of the type "There will be a naval battle tomor row" constitute a date or order-word?)

The independence of the form of expression and the form of content is not the basis for a parallelism between them or a representation of one by the other, but on the contrary a parceling of the two, a manner in which expressions are inserted into contents, in which we ceaselessly jump from one register to another, in which signs are at work in things themselves just as things extend into or are deployed through signs. An assemblage of enunciation does not speak "of" things; it speaks *on the same level as *states of things and states of content. So that the same x, the same particle, may function either as a body that acts and undergoes actions or as a sign constituting an act or order-word, depending on which form it is taken up by (for example, the theoretico-experimental aggregate of physics). In short, the functional in dependence of the two forms is only the form of their reciprocal presup position, and of the continual passage from one to the other. We are never presented with an interlinkage of order-words and a causality of contents each in its own right; nor do we see one represent the other, with the second serving as referent. On the contrary, the independence of the two lines is distributive, such that a segment of one always forms a relay with a segment of the other, slips into, introduces itself into the other. We constantly pass from order-words to the "silent order" of things, as Foucault puts it, and vice versa. But when we use a word as vague as "intervene," when we say that expressions intervene or insert themselves into contents, are we not still prey to a kind of idealism in which the order-word instantaneously falls from the sky? What we must determine is not an origin but points of inter vention or insertion in the framework of the reciprocal presupposition of the two forms. Both forms of content and forms of expression are insepara ble from a movement of deterritorialization that carries them away. Both expression and content are more or less deterritorialized, relatively deterritorialized, according to the particular state of their form. In this respect, one cannot posit a primacy of expression over content, or content over expression. Sometimes the semiotic components are more deter ritorialized than the material components, and sometimes the reverse. For example, a mathematical complex of signs may be more deterritorialized than a set of particles; conversely, the particles may have experimental effects that deterritorialize the semiotic system. A criminal action may be deterritorializing in relation to the existing regime of signs (the earth cries for revenge and crumbles beneath my feet, my offense is too great); but the sign that expresses the act of condemnation may in turn be deter ritorializing in relation to all actions and reactions ("a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the earth" [Gen. 4:12], you cannot even be killed). In short, there are degrees of deterritorialization that quantify the

What we call circum stances or variables are these degrees themselves. There are *variables of  content, *or proportions in the interminglings or aggregations of bodies, and there are *variables of expression, *factors internal to enunciation. Germany, toward November 20, 1923: on the one hand, the deterritorializing infla tion of the monetary body and, on the other, in response to the inflation, a semiotic transformation of the reichsmark into the rentenmark, making possible a reterritorialization. Russia, toward July 4,1917: on the one hand proportions of a state of "bodies" Soviets-provisional government, and on the other the elaboration of a Bolshevik incorporeal semiotic, accelerating things and contributing to the action of the detonating body of the Party. In short, the way an expression relates to a content is not by uncovering or rep resenting it. Rather, forms of expression and forms of content communi cate through a conjunction of their quanta of relative deterritorialization, each intervening, operating in the other. We may draw some general conclusions on the nature of Assemblages from this. On a first, horizontal, axis, an assemblage comprises two seg ments, one of content, the other of expression. On the one hand it is a  *machinic assemblage *of bodies, of actions and passions, an intermingling of bodies reacting to one another; on the other hand it is a *collective assem-  blage of enunciation, *of acts and statements, of incorporeal transforma tions attributed to bodies. Then on a vertical axis, the assemblage has both  *territorial sides, *or reterritorialized sides, which stabilize it, and *cutting  edges of deterritorialization, *which carry it away. No one is better than Kafka at differentiating the two axes of the assemblage and making them function together. On the one hand, the ship-machine, the hotel-machine, the circus-machine, the castle-machine, the court-machine, each with its own intermingled pieces, gears, processes, and bodies contained in one another or bursting out of containment (see the head bursting through the roof) 19 On the other hand, the regime of signs or of enunciation: each regime with its incorporeal transformations, acts, death sentences and judgments, proceedings, "law." It is obvious that statements do not repre sent machines: the Stoker's discourse does not describe stoking as a body; it has its own form, and a development without resemblance. 20 Yet it is attributed to bodies, to the whole ship as a body. A discourse of submission to order-words; a discourse of discussion, claims, accusation, and defense. On the second axis, what is compared or combined of the two aspects, what always inserts one into the other, are the sequenced or conjugated degrees of deterritorialization, and the operations of reterritorialization that stabi lize the aggregate at a given moment.

Taking the feudal assemblage as an example, we would have to consider the interminglings of bodies defining feudalism: the body of the earth and the social body; the body of the over lord, vassal, and serf; the body of the knight and the horse and their new relation to the stirrup; the weapons and tools assuring a symbiosis of bodies—a whole machinic assemblage. We would also have to consider statements, expressions, the juridical regime of heraldry, all of the incorpo real transformations, in particular, oaths and their variables (the oath of obedience, but also the oath of love, etc.): the collective assemblage of enunciation. On the other axis, we would have to consider the feudal territorialities and reterritorializations, and at the same time the line of deterritorialization that carries away both the knight and his mount, state ments and acts. We would have to consider how all this combines in the Crusades. It would be an error to believe that content determines expression by causal action, even if expression is accorded the power not only to "reflect" content but to react upon it in an active way. This kind of ideological con ception of the statement, which subordinates it to a primary economic con tent, runs into all kinds of difficulties inherent to dialectics. First, although it may be possible to conceive of a causal action moving from content to expression, the same cannot be said for the respective *forms, *the form of content and the form of expression. We must recognize that expression is independent and that this is precisely what enables it to react upon con tents. This independence, however, has been poorly conceived. If contents are said to be economic, the form of content cannot be said to be economic and is reduced to a pure abstraction, namely, the production of goods and the means of that production considered in themselves. Similarly, if ex pressions are said to be ideological, the form of expression is not said to be ideological and is reduced to language as abstraction, as the availability of a good shared by all. Those who take this approach claim to characterize contents and expressions by all the struggles and conflicts pervading them in two different forms, but these forms themselves are exempt from strug gle and conflict, and the relation between them remains entirely indeter minate. 21 The only way to define the relation is to revamp the theory of ideology by saying that expressions and statements intervene directly in productivity, in the form of a production of meaning or sign-value. The category of production doubtless has the advantage of breaking with schemas of representation, information, and communication. But is it any more adequate than these schemas?

We think the material or machinic aspect of an assemblage relates not to the production of goods but rather to a precise state of intermingling of bodies in a society, including all the attractions and repulsions, sympathies and antipathies, alterations, amalgamations, penetrations, and expansions that affect bodies of all kinds in their relations to one another. What regulates the obligatory, necessary, or permitted interminglings of bodies is above all an alimentary regime and a sexual regime. Even technology makes the mistake of considering tools in isolation: tools exist only in rela tion to the interminglings they make possible or that make them possible. The stirrup entails a new man-horse symbiosis that at the same time entails new weapons and new instruments. Tools are inseparable from symbioses or amalgamations defining a Nature-Society machinic assemblage. They presuppose a social machine that selects them and takes them into its "phy lum": a society is defined by its amalgamations, not by its tools. Similarly, the semiotic or collective aspect of an assemblage relates not to a produc tivity of language but to regimes of signs, to a machine of expression whose variables determine the usage of language elements. These elements do not stand on their own any more than tools do. There is a primacy of the machinic assemblage of bodies over tools and goods, a primacy of the col lective assemblage of enunciation over language and words. The articula tion of the two aspects of the assemblage is effected by the movements of deterritorialization that quantify their forms. That is why a social field is defined less by its conflicts and contradictions than by the lines of flight running through it. An assemblage has neither base nor superstructure, neither deep structure nor superficial structure; it flattens all of its dimen sions onto a single plane of consistency upon which reciprocal presupposi tions and mutual insertions play themselves out. The other mistake (which is combined with the first as needed) is to believe in the adequacy of the form of expression as a linguistic system. This system may be conceived as a signifying phonological structure, or as a deep syntactical structure. In either case, it is credited with engendering semantics, therefore of fulfilling expression, whereas contents are rele gated to the arbitrariness of a simple "reference" and pragmatics to the exteriority of nonlinguistic factors. What all of these undertakings have in common is to erect an *abstract machine of language, *but as a synchronic set of constants. We will not object that the machine thus conceived is too abstract. On the contrary, it is not abstract enough, it remains "linear." It remains on an intermediate level of abstraction allowing it to consider lin guistic factors in themselves, independently of nonlinguistic factors, and

But if the abstraction is taken  further, one necessarily reaches a level where the pseudoconstants of lan-  guage are superseded by variables of expression internal to enunciation  itself; these variables of expression are then no longer separable from the  variables of content with which they are in perpetual interaction. *If the  external pragmatics of nonlinguistic factors must be taken into considera-  tion, it is because linguistics itself is inseparable from an internal prag-  matics involving its own factors. *It is not enough to take into account the  signified, or even the referent, because the very notions of signification  and reference are bound up with a supposedly autonomous and constant  structure. There is no use constructing a semantics, or even recognizing a  certain validity to pragmatics, if they are still pretreated by a phonological  or syntactical machine. For a true abstract machine pertains to an assem-  blage in its entirety: it is defined as the diagram of that assemblage. It is not  language based but diagrammatic and superlinear. Content is not a signi-  fied nor expression a signifier; rather, both are variables of the assemblage.  We get nowhere until the pragmatic, but also semantic, syntactical, and  phonological determinations are directly linked to the assemblages of  enunciation upon which they depend. Chomsky's abstract machine retains  an arborescent model and a linear ordering of linguistic elements in sen-  tences and sentence combinations. But as soon as pragmatic values or  internal variables are taken into account, in particular with respect to indi-  rect discourse, one is obliged to bring "hypersentences" into play or to con-  struct "abstract objects" (incorporeal transformations). This implies  superlinearity, in other words, a plane whose elements no longer have a  fixed linear order: the rhizome model. 22 From this standpoint, the inter-penetration of language and the social field and political problems  lies at the deepest level of the abstract machine, not at the surface. The  abstract machine as it relates to the diagram of the assemblage is never  purely a matter of language, except for lack of sufficient abstraction. It is  language that depends on the abstract machine, not the reverse. At most,  we may distinguish in the abstract machine two states of the diagram,  one in which variables of content and expression are distributed according  to their heterogeneous forms in reciprocal presupposition on a plane of  consistency, and another in which it is no longer even possible to  distinguish between variables of content and expression because the  variability of that same plane has prevailed over the duality of forms,  rendering them "indiscernible." (The first state relates to still relative  movements of deterritori-alization; in the second, an absolute threshold  of deterritorialization has been reached.)

92 □ NOVEMBER 20, 1923: POSTULATES OF LINGUISTICS III. **"There Are Constants or Universals of Language That Enable Us to ** **Define It as a Homogeneous System"** The question of structural invariants—and the very idea of structure is inseparable from invariants, whether atomic or relational—is essential to linguistics. It is what allows linguistics to claim a basis in pure scientificity, to be nothing but science ... safe from any supposedly external or prag matic factor. The question of invariants assumes several closely connected forms: (1) the constants of a language (phonological, by commutativity; syntactical, by transformativity; semantic, by generativity); (2) the uni versals of language (by decomposition of the phoneme into distinctive features; of syntax into fundamental constituents; of signification into minimal semantic elements); (3) trees linking constants to one another, with binary relations between trees (see Chomsky's linear arborescent method); (4) competence, in principle coextensive with language and defined by judgments of grammaticality; (5) homogeneity, bearing on ele ments and relations as well as intuitive judgments; (6) synchrony, which erects an "in-itself' and a "for-itself' of language, perpetually moving from the objective system to the subjective consciousness that apprehends its principle (that of the linguist himself or herself). One can juggle all of these factors, subtract some or even add new ones. They go together, however, because the essentials of all of them are present on the level of any one. For example, the distinction between speech and language is recapitulated in the distinction between competence and per formance, but at the level of grammaticality. If it is objected that the dis tinction between competence and performance is entirely relative (a linguistic competence can be economic, religious, political, or aesthetic, etc.; the teaching competence of a grade school teacher may be only a per formance in relation to the judgment of an inspector or government regula tions), linguists respond that they are willing to multiply levels of competence, and even to introduce pragmatic values into the system. Brekle, for example, proposes adding an "idiosyncratic performatory com petence" factor tied to a whole constellation of linguistic, psychological, or sociological factors. But what use is this injection of pragmatics if pragmatics is in turn considered to have constants or universals of its own? And in what way are expressions like "I," "promise," "know" more univer sal than "greet," "name," or "condemn"? 23 Similarly, when efforts are made to make Chomsky's trees bud and to shatter linear order, as long as the pragmatic components marking the ruptures are placed above the tree or effaced from the derivation nothing has really been accomplished, one has failed to constitute a rhizome. 24 In truth, the nature of the abstract machine is the most general problem: there is no reason to tie the abstract

0 NOVEMBER 20, 1923: POSTULATES OF LINGUISTICS □ 93 to the universal or the constant, or to efface the singularity of abstract  machines insofar as they are built around variables and variations. The debate between Chomsky and Labov will give us a better under standing of what the issue is. Every language is an essentially heterogene-  ous reality; linguists know this and say so. But this is a *factual *remark.  Chomsky asks only that one carve from this aggregate a homogeneous or  standard system as a basis for abstraction or idealization, making possible  a scientific study *of principles. *Limiting oneself to standard English is thus  not the issue, for even a linguist who studies Black English or the English of  the ghettos is obliged to extract a standard system guaranteeing the con-  stancy and homogeneity of the object under study (no science can operate  any other way, they say). Thus Chomsky pretends to believe that by assert-  ing his interest in the variable features of language, Labov is situating him-  self in a de facto pragmatics external to linguistics. 25 Labov, however, has other ambitions. When he brings to light lines *of inherent variation, *he does  not see them simply as "free variants" pertaining to pronunciation, style,  or nonpertinent features that lie outside the system and leave the homoge-  neity of the system intact; neither does he see them as a de facto mix  between two systems, each homogeneous in its own right, as if the speaker  moved from one to the other. He refuses the alternative linguistics set up  for itself: assigning variants to different systems, or relegating them to a  place outside the structure. It is the variation itself that is systematic, in the  sense in which musicians say that "the theme is the variation." Labov sees  variation as a de jure component affecting each system from within, send-  ing it cascading or leaping on its own power and forbidding one to close it  off, to make it homogeneous in principle. Labov does consider variables of  all kinds, phonetic, phonological, syntactical, semantic, stylistic. Yet it  would seem difficult to accuse him of missing the distinction between the  de jure and the de facto—or between linguistics and stylistics, or  synchrony and diachrony, or pertinent and nonpertinent features, or com-  petence and performance, or the grammaticality of language and the  agrammaticality of speech. Although this may be hardening his positions,  we would say rather that Labov proposes a different distribution of the de  facto and the de jure, and especially a different conception of the de jure  itself and of abstraction. He takes the example of a young black person  who, in a very short series of phrases, seems to pass from the Black English  system to the standard system eighteen times. Is it not the abstract distinc-  tion between the two systems that proves arbitrary and insufficient? For  the majority of the forms belongs to one or the other only by virtue of the  fortuities of a given sequence. Must it not be admitted that every system is  in variation and is defined not by its constants and homogeneity but on the

94 □ NOVEMBER 20, 1923: POSTULATES OF LINGUISTICS contrary by a variability whose characteristics are immanent, continuous, and regulated in a very specific mode *(variable or optional *rules)? 25 How can we conceptualize this continuous variation at work within a language, even if it means overstepping the limits Labov sets for himself as well as the conditions of scientificity invoked by linguistics? In the course of a single day, an individual repeatedly passes from language to language. He successively speaks as "father to son" and as a boss; to his lover, he speaks an infantilized language; while sleeping he is plunged into an oniric discourse, then abruptly returns to a professional language when the tele phone rings. It will be objected that these variations are extrinsic, that it is still the same language. But that is to prejudge the question. First, it is not certain that the phonology is the same, nor the syntax, nor the semantics. Second, the whole question is whether this supposedly identical language is defined by invariants or, on the contrary, by the line of continuous varia tion running through it. Some linguists have suggested that linguistic change occurs less by systemic rupture than by a gradual modification of frequency, by a coexistence and continuity of different usages. Take as an example the statement, "I swear!" It is a different statement depending on whether it is said by a child to his or her father, by a man in love to his loved one, or by a witness before the court. These are like three sequences. (Or Messiaen's four "amen"s stretched over seven sequences.) Once again, there is no reason to say that the variables are merely situational, and that the statement remains constant in principle. Not only are there as many statements as there are effectuations, but all of the statements are present in the effectuation of one among them, so that the line of variation is vir tual, in other words, real without being actual, and consequently continu ous regardless of the leaps the statement makes. To place the statement in continuous variation is to send it through all the prosodic, semantic, syn tactical, and phonological variables that can affect it in the shortest moment of time (the smallest interval). Build the *continuum *of "I swear!" with the corresponding transformations. This is the standpoint of pragmatics, but a pragmatics internal to language, immanent, including variations of linguistic elements of all kinds. For example, Kafka's line of the three proceedings: the father's proceedings in the family; the engage ment proceedings at the hotel; and the court proceedings. There is a con stant tendency to seek a "reduction": everything is explained by the situation of the child in relation to its father, or of the man in relation to castration, or of the citizen in relation to the law. But this is to content one self with extracting a pseudoconstant of content, which is no better than extracting a pseudoconstant of expression. Placing-in-variation allows us to avoid these dangers, because it builds a continuum or medium without beginning or end. Continuous variation should not be confused with the

A variable can be continuous over a portion of its trajectory, then leap or skip, without that affecting its continuous variation; what this does is impose an absent development as an "alternative continuity" that is virtual yet real. A constant or invariant is defined less by its permanence and duration than by its function as a center, if only relative. In the tonal or diatonic sys tem of music, laws of resonance and attraction determine centers valid for all modes and endowed with stability and attractive power *(pouvoir). *These centers therefore organize distinct, distinctive, forms that are clearly estab lished for a certain amount of time: a linear, codified, centered system of the arborescent type. It is true that the minor "mode" gives tonal music a decentered, runaway, fugitive character due to the nature of its intervals and the lesser stability of its chords. This mode thus has the ambiguity of undergoing operations that align it to a major model or standard at the same time as it continues to display a certain modal power *(puissance) *irre ducible to tonality, as though music set out on a journey and garnered all resurgences, phantoms of the Orient, imaginary lands, traditions from all over. But temperament, tempered chromaticism has an even greater ambi guity: stretching the action of the center to the most distant tones, but also preparing the disaggregation of the central principle, replacing the cen tered forms of continuous development with a form that constantly dis solves and transforms itself. When development subordinates form and spans the whole, as in Beethoven, variation begins to free itself and becomes identified with creation. But when chromaticism is unleashed, becomes a generalized chromaticism, turns back against temperament, affecting not only pitches but all sound components—durations, intensi ties, timbre, attacks—it becomes impossible to speak of a sound form organizing matter; it is no longer even possible to speak of a continuous development of form. Rather, it is a question of a highly complex and elab orate material making audible nonsonorous forces. The couple matter-form is replaced by the coupling material-forces. The synthesizer has taken the place of the old "a priori synthetic judgment," and all functions change accordingly. By placing all its components in continuous variation, music itself becomes a superlinear system, a rhizome instead of a tree, and enters the service of a virtual cosmic continuum of which even holes, silences, ruptures, and breaks are a part. Thus the important thing is certainly not to establish a pseudobreak between the tonal system and atonal music; the latter, on the contrary, in breaking away from the tonal system, only carried temperament to its ultimate conclusion (although no Viennese stopped there). The essential thing is almost the opposite movement: the ferment in the tonal system itself (during much of the nineteenth and twentieth cen

This ferment came to the forefront and made itself heard in its own right; and, through the molecular material thus wrought, it made audible the nonsonorous forces of the cosmos that have always agitated music—a bit of Time in the pure state, 27 a grain of absolute Intensity... The words "tonal," "modal," "atonal" do not mean much. Music is not alone in being art as cosmos and in drawing the virtual lines of an infinite variation. Once again, the objection will be raised that music is not a language, that the components of sound are not pertinent features of language, that there is no correspondence between the two. We are not suggesting any corre spondence. We keep asking that the issue be left open, that any presup posed distinction be rejected. This especially applies to the language-speech distinction, which is used to relegate all kinds of variables at work within expression and enunciation to a position outside language. The Voice-Music relation proposed by Jean-Jacques Rousseau, on the other hand, could have taken not only phonetics and prosody but all of linguistics in a different direction. The voice in music has always been a privileged axis of experimentation, playing simultaneously on language and sound. Music has linked the voice to instruments in various ways; but as long as the voice is song, its main role is to "hold" sound, it functions as a constant circumscribed on a note and *accompanied *by the instrument. Only when the voice is tied to timbre does it reveal a tessitura that renders it heterogeneous to itself and gives it a power of continuous variation: it is then no longer accompanied, but truly "machined," it belongs to a musical machine that prolongs or superposes on a single plane parts that are spoken, sung, achieved by special effects, instrumental, or perhaps electronically generated. This is the sound plane of a generalized "glissando" implying the constitution of a statistical space in which each variable has, not an average value, but a probability of frequency that places it in continuous variation with the other variables. 28 Luciano Berio's *Visage *(Face) and Dieter Schnebel's *Glossolalie * (Speaking in tongues) are typical examples of this. And despite what Berio himself says, it is less a matter of using pseudoconstants to produce a simulacrum of language or a metaphor for the voice than of attaining that secret neuter language without constants and entirely in indirect discourse where the synthesizer and the instrument speak no less than the voice, and the voice plays no less than the instrument. It should not be thought that music has forgotten how to sing in a now mechanical and atomized world; rather, an immense coefficient of variation is affecting and carrying away all of the phatic, aphatic, linguistic,

NOVEMBER 20, 1923: POSTULATES OF LINGUISTICS □ 97 poetic, instrumental, or musical parts of a single sound assemblage—"a simple scream suffusing all degrees" (Thomas Mann). There are many pro cedures for placing the voice in variation, not only *Sprechgesang * (speech-song), which constantly leaves pitch behind by descent or ascent, but also circular breathing techniques and zones of resonance in which several voices seem to issue from the same mouth. Secret languages are very significant in this connection, in learned as well as popular music. Certain ethnomusicologists have found extraordinary cases (in Dahomey, for example) where a first, diatonic, vocal part is superseded by a chromatic descent into a secret language that slips from one sound to the next in a continuous fashion, modulating a sound continuum into smaller and smaller intervals until it becomes a "parlando" all of the intervals of which blur together—and then the diatonic part is itself transposed according to the chromatic levels of a terraced architecture, the song sometimes interrupted by a parlando, by a simple conversation lacking definite pitch. 29 It is perhaps characteristic of secret languages, slangs, jargons, professional languages, nursery rhymes, merchants' cries to stand out less for their lexical inventions or rhetorical figures than for the way in which they effect continuous variations of the common elements of language. They are chromatic languages, close to a musical notation. A secret language does not merely have a hidden cipher or code still operating by constants and forming a subsystem; *it places the public  language's system of variables in a state ofvariation.* This is what we are getting at: a generalized chromaticism. Placing ele ments of any nature in continuous variation is an operation that will per haps give rise to new distinctions, but takes none as final and has none in advance. On the contrary, this operation in principle bears on the voice, speech, language, and music simultaneously. There is no reason to make prior, principled distinctions. Linguistics in general is still in a kind of major mode, still has a sort of diatonic scale and a strange taste for domi nants, constants, and universals. All languages, in the meantime, are in immanent continuous variation: neither synchrony nor diachrony, but asynchrony, chromaticism as a variable and continuous state of language. For a chromatic linguistics according pragmatism its intensities and values. What is called a style can be the most natural thing in the world; it is nothing other than the procedure of a continuous variation. Of the dual isms established by linguistics, there are few with a more shaky foundation than the separation between linguistics and stylistics: Because a style is not an individual psychological creation but an assemblage of enunciation, it unavoidably produces a language within a language.

0 98 □ NOVEMBER 20, 1923: POSTULATES OF LINGUISTICS Luc Godard. It will be noted that they are all more or less in a bilingual situ ation: Kafka, the Czechoslovakian Jew writing in German; Beckett, the Irishman writing in English and French; Luca, originally from Romania; Godard and his will to be Swiss. But this is only circumstantial, an oppor tunity, and the opportunity can be found elsewhere. It will also be noted that many of them are not only or not primarily writers (Beckett and theater and television, Godard and film and television, Luca and his audiovisual machines). The reason for this is that when one submits lin guistic elements to a treatment producing continuous variation, when one introduces an internal pragmatics into language, one is necessarily led to treat nonlinguistic elements such as gestures and instruments in the same fashion, as if the two aspects of pragmatics joined on the same line of varia tion, in the same continuum. Moreover, the idea perhaps comes first from outside, with language following only later, as with the necessarily exterior sources of a style. But the essential thing is that each of these authors has his own procedure of variation, his own widened chromaticism, his own mad production of speeds and intervals. The creative stammering of Gherasim Luca, in the poem "Passionnement" (Passionately). 30 Godard's is another kind of stammering. In theater: Robert Wilson's whispering, without defi nite pitch, and Carmelo Bene's ascending and descending variations. 31 It's easy to stammer, but making language itself stammer is a different affair; it involves placing all linguistic, and even nonlinguistic, elements in varia tion, both variables of expression and variables of content. A new form of redundancy, AND ... AND ... AND ... There has always been a struggle in language between the verb *etre *(to be) and the conjunction *et *(and) between  *est *and *et *(is and and [which in French are identical in pronunciation— Trans.]) It is only in appearance that these two terms are in accord and combine, for the first acts in language as a constant and forms the diatonic scale of language, while the second places everything in variation, consti tuting the lines of a generalized chromaticism. From one to the other, everything shifts. Writers in British or American English have been more conscious than the French of this struggle and the stakes involved, and of the valence of the "and." 32 It was Proust who said that "masterpieces are written in a kind of foreign language." That is the same as stammering, making language stammer rather than stammering in speech. To be a for eigner, but in one's own tongue, not only when speaking a language other than one's own. To be bilingual, multilingual, but in one and the same lan guage, without even a dialect or patois. To be a bastard, a half-breed, but through a purification of race. That is when style becomes a language. That is when language becomes intensive, a pure continuum of values and inten sities. That is when all of language becomes secret, yet has nothing to hide, as opposed to when one carves out a secret subsystem within language. One

0 NOVEMBER 20, 1923: POSTULATES OF LINGUISTICS □ 99 attains this result only by sobriety, creative subtraction. Continuous varia tion has only ascetic lines, a touch of herb and pure water. It is possible to take any linguistic variable and place it in variation fol lowing a necessarily virtual continuous line between two of its states. We are no longer in the situation of linguists who expect the constants of lan guage to experience a kind of mutation or undergo the effects of changes accumulated in speech alone. Lines of change or creation are fully and directly a part of the abstract machine. Hjelmslev remarked that a language necessarily includes unexploited possibilities or potentialities and that the abstract machine must include these possibilities or potentialities. 33 "Potential" and "virtual" are not at all in opposition to "real"; on the con trary, the reality of the creative, or the placing-in-continuous variation of variables, is in opposition only to the actual determination of their con stant relations. Each time we draw a line of variation, the variables are of a particular nature (phonological, syntactical or grammatical, semantic, and so on), but the line itself is apertinent, asyntactic or agrammatical, asemantic. Agrammaticality, for example, is no longer a contingent char acteristic of speech opposed to the grammaticality of language; rather, it is the ideal characteristic of a line placing grammatical variables in a state of continuous variation. Let us take Nicolas Ruwet's examples of certain sin gular expressions of Cummings's: "he danced his did," or "they went their came." It is possible to reconstitute the variations through which the gram matical variables pass in virtuality in order to end up as agrammatical expressions of this kind ("he did his dance," "he danced his dance," "he danced what he did,"...; "they went as they came," "they went their way," .. .). 34 In spite of Ruwet's structural interpretation, we should avoid taking the view that the atypical expression is produced by the successive correct forms. It is instead the atypical expression that produces the placing-in-variation of the correct forms, uprooting them from their state as constants. The atypical expression constitutes a cutting edge of deterritorialization of language, it plays the role *of tensor; *in other words, it causes language to tend toward the limit of its elements, forms, or notions, toward a near side or a beyond of language. The tensor effects a kind of transitivization of the phrase, causing the last term to react upon the pre ceding term, back through the entire chain. It assures an intensive and chromatic treatment of language. An expression as simple as AND . . . can play the role of tensor for all of language. In this sense, AND is less a conjunction than the atypical expression of all of the possible conjunctions it places in continuous variation. The tensor, therefore, is not reducible either to a constant or a variable, but assures the variation of the variable by subtracting in each instance the value of the constant *(n *\- 1). Tensors coincide with no linguistic category; nevertheless they are pragmatic

That is because they wish to define the abstract machine by con stants that can be modified only secondarily, by a cumulative effect or syntagmatic mutation. But the abstract machine of language is not univer sal, or even general, but singular; it is not actual, but virtual-real; it has, not invariable or obligatory rules, but optional rules that ceaselessly vary with the variation itself, as in a game in which each move changes the rules. That is why abstract machines and assemblages of enunciation are complemen tary, and present in each other. The abstract machine is like the diagram of an assemblage. It draws lines of continuous variation, while the concrete assemblage treats variables and organized their highly diverse relations as a function of those lines. The assemblage negotiates variables at this or that level of variation, according to this or that degree of deterritorialization, and determines which variables will enter into constant relations or obey obligatory rules and which will serve instead as a fluid matter for variation. We should not conclude from this that the assemblage brings only a certain resistance or inertia to bear against the abstract machine; for even "con stants" are essential to the determination of the virtualities through which the variation passes, they are themselves optionally chosen. There is indeed braking and resistance at a certain level, but at another level of the assemblage there is nothing but a come-and-go between different types of variables, and corridors of passage traveled in both directions: the varia bles effectuate the machine in unison, in the sum of their relations. There is therefore no basis for a distinction between a constant and collective lan guage, and variable and individual speech acts. The abstract machine is always singular, designated by the proper mane of a group or individual, while the assemblage of enunciation is always collective, in the individual as in the group. The Lenin abstract machine, and the Bolshevik collective assemblage .. . The same goes for literature, for music. There is no primacy of the individual; there is instead an indissolubility of a singular Abstract and a collective Concrete. The abstract machine does not exist indepen dently of the assemblage, any more than the assemblage functions inde pendently of the machine. **IV.

It is a question of extracting a set of constants from the variables, or of determining constant relations between variables (this is already evident in the phonologists' concept of commutativity). But the scientific model taking language as an object of study is one with the political model by which language is homog enized, centralized, standardized, becoming a language of power, a major or dominant language. Linguistics can claim all it wants to be science, nothing but pure science—it wouldn't be the first time that the order of pure science was used to secure the requirements of another order. What is grammaticality, and the sign S, the categorical symbol that dominates statements? It is a power marker before it is a syntactical marker, and Chomsky's trees establish constant relations between power variables. Forming grammatically correct sentences is for the normal individual the prerequisite for any submission to social laws. No one is supposed to be ignorant of grammaticality; those who are belong in special institutions. The unity of language is fundamentally political. There is no mother tongue, only a power takeover by a dominant language that at times advances along a broad front, and at times swoops down on diverse centers simultaneously. We can conceive of several ways for a language to homoge nize, centralize: the republican way is not necessarily the same as the royal way, and is not the least harsh. 36 The scientific enterprise of extracting con stants and constant relations is always coupled with the political enterprise of imposing them on speakers and transmitting order-words. Speak white and loud yes what a wonderful language for hiring giving orders appointing the hour of death in the works and of the break that refreshes . . . Must a distinction then be made between two kinds of languages, "high" and "low," major and minor? The first would be defined precisely by the power *(pouvoir) *of constants, the second by the power *(puissance) *of varia tion. We do not simply wish to make an opposition between the unity of a major language and the multiplicity of dialects. Rather, each dialect has a zone of transition and variation; or better, each minor language has a prop erly dialectical zone of variation. According to Malmberg, it is rare to find clear boundaries on dialect maps; instead, there are transitional and limitrophe zones, zones of indiscernibility. It is also said that "the Quebecois language is so rich in modulations and variations of regional accents and in games with tonic accents that it sometimes seems, with no exaggeration, that it would be better preserved by musical notation than by

0 102 □ NOVEMBER 20, 1923: POSTULATES OF LINGUISTICS any system of spelling." 37 The very notion of dialect is quite questionable. Moreover, it is relative because one needs to know in relation to what major language it exercises its function: for example, the Quebecois language must be evaluated not only in relation to standard French but also in rela tion to major English, from which it borrows all kinds of phonetic and syn tactical elements, in order to set them in variation. The Bantu dialects must be evaluated not only in relation to the mother tongue but also in rela tion to Afrikaans as a major language, and English as a counter-major lan guage preferred by blacks. 38 In short, the notion of dialect does not elucidate that of minor language, but the other way around; it is the minor language that defines dialects through its own possibilities for variation. Should we identify major and minor languages on the basis of regional situ ations of bilingualism or multilingualism including at least one dominant language and one dominated language, or a world situation giving certain languages an imperialist power over others (for example, the role of Ameri can English today)? At least two things prevent us from adopting this point of view. As Chomsky notes, a dialect, ghetto language, or minor language is not immune to the kind of treatment that draws a homogeneous system from it and extracts constants: Black English has its own grammar, which is not defined by a sum of mistakes or infractions against standard English; but that grammar can be studied only by applying to it the same rules of study that are applied to standard English. In this sense, the notions of major and minor seem to have no linguistic relevance. When French lost its world wide major function it lost nothing of its constancy and homogeneity, its centralization. Conversely, Afrikaans attained homogeneity when it was a locally minor language struggling against English. Even politically, espe cially politically, it is difficult to see how the upholders of a minor language can operate if not by giving it (if only by writing in it) a constancy and homogeneity making it a locally major language capable of forcing official recognition (hence the political role of writers who assert the rights of a minor language). But the opposite argument seems more compelling: the more a language has or acquires the characteristics of a major language, the more it is affected by continuous variations that transpose it into a "minor" language. It is futile to criticize the worldwide imperialism of a language by denouncing the corruptions it introduces into other languages (for example, the purists' criticisms of English influences in French, the petit-bourgeois or academic denunciation of "Franglais"). For if a lan guage such as British English or American English is major on a world scale, it is necessarily worked upon by all the minorities of the world, using very diverse procedures of variation. Take the way Gaelic and Irish English set English in variation. Or the way Black English and any number of

0 NOVEMBER 20, 1923: POSTULATES OF LINGUISTICS □ 103 "ghetto languages" set American English in variation, to the point that New York is virtually a city without a language. (Furthermore, American English could not have *constituted *itself without this linguistic labor of the minorities.) Or the linguistic situation in the old Austrian empire: German was a major language in relation to the minorities, but as such it could not avoid being treated by those minorities in a way that made it a minor language in relation to the German of the Germans. There is no language that does not have intralinguistic, endogenous, internal minorities. So at the most general level of linguistics, Chomsky's and Labov's positions are constantly passing and converting into each other. Chomsky can say that even a minor, dialectical, or ghetto language cannot be studied unless invariants are extracted from it and "extrinsic or mixed" variables are eliminated; and Labov can respond that even a standard or major language cannot be studied independently of "inherent" variations, which are pre cisely neither mixed nor extrinsic. *You will never find a homogeneous sys-  tem that is not still or already affected by a regulated, continuous, immanent  process of variation *(why does Chomsky pretend not to understand this?). There are not, therefore, two kinds of languages but two possible treat ments of the same language. Either the variables are treated in such a way as to extract from them constants and constant relations or in such a way as to place them in continuous variation. We were wrong to give the impres sion at times that constants existed alongside variables, linguistic con stants alongside variables of enunciation: that was only for convenience of presentation. For it is obvious that the constants are drawn from the varia bles themselves; universals in linguistics have no more existence in them selves than they do in economics and are always concluded from a universalization or a rendering-uniform involving variables. *Constant is  not opposed to variable; *it is a treatment of the variable opposed to the other kind of treatment, or continuous variation. So-called obligatory rules cor respond to the first kind of treatment, whereas optional rules concern the construction of a continuum of variation. Moreover, there are a certain number of categories or distinctions that cannot be invoked, that are inap plicable and useless as a basis for objections because they presuppose the first treatment and are entirely subordinated to the quest for constants: for example, language as opposed to speech; synchrony as opposed to diachrony; competence as opposed to performance; distinctive features as opposed to nondistinctive (or secondarily distinctive) features. For nondistinctive features, whether prosodic, stylistic, or pragmatic, are not only omnipresent variables, in contrast to the presence or absence of a con stant; they are not only superlinear and "suprasegmental" elements, in contrast to linear segmental elements; their very characteristics give them the power to place all the elements of language in a state of continuous

0 104 □ NOVEMBER 20, 1923: POSTULATES OF LINGUISTICS variation—for example, the impact of tone on phonemes, accent on mor phemes, or intonation on syntax. These are not secondary features but another treatment of language that no longer operates according to the pre ceding categories. "Major" and "minor" do not qualify two different languages but rather two usages or functions of language. Bilingualism, of course, provides a good example, but once again we use it simply for the sake of convenience. Doubtless, in the Austrian empire Czech was a minor language in relation to German; but the German of Prague already functioned as a potentially minor language in relation to the German of Vienna or Berlin; and Kafka, a Czechoslovakian Jew writing in German, submits German to creative treatment as a minor language, constructing a continuum of variation, negotiating all of the variables both to constrict the constants and to expand the variables: make language stammer, or make it "wail," stretch tensors through all of language, even written language, and draw from it cries, shouts, pitches, durations, timbres, accents, intensities. Two con joined tendencies in so-called minor languages have often been noted: an impoverishment, a shedding of syntactical and lexical forms; but simulta neously a strange proliferation of shifting effects, a taste for overload and paraphrase. This applies to the German of Prague, Black English, and Quebecois. But with rare exceptions, the interpretation of the linguists has been rather malevolent, invoking a consubstantial poverty and preciosity. The alleged poverty is in fact a restriction of constants and the overload an extension of variations functioning to deploy a continuum sweeping up all components. The poverty is not a lack but a void or ellipsis allowing one to sidestep a constant instead of tackling it head on, or to approach it from above or below instead of positioning oneself within it. And the overload is not a rhetorical figure, a metaphor, or symbolic structure; it is a mobile par aphrase bearing witness to the unlocalized presence of an indirect dis course at the heart of every statement. From both sides we see a rejection of reference points, a dissolution of constant form in favor of differences in dynamic. The closer a language gets to this state, the closer it comes not only to a system of musical notation, but also to music itself. 39 Subtract and place in variation, remove and place in variation: a single operation. Minor languages are characterized not by overload and poverty in relation to a standard or major language, but by a sobriety and variation that are like a minor treatment of the standard language, a becoming-minor of the major language. The problem is not the distinction between major and minor language; it is one of a becoming. It is a question not of reterritorializing oneself on a dialect or a patois but of deterritorializing the major language. Black Americans do not oppose Black to English, they transform the American English that is their own language into Black

0 NOVEMBER 20, 1923: POSTULATES OF LINGUISTICS □ 105 English. Minor languages do not exist in themselves: they exist only in rela tion to a major language and are also investments of that language for the purpose of making it minor. One must find the minor language, the dialect or rather idiolect, on the basis of which one can make one's own major lan guage minor. That is the strength of authors termed "minor," who are in fact the greatest, the only greats: having to conquer one's own language, in other words, to attain that sobriety in the use of a major language, in order to place it in a state of continuous variation (the opposite of regionalism). It is in one's own language that one is bilingual or multilingual. Conquer the major language in order to delineate in it as yet unknown minor languages. Use the minor language to *send the major language racing. *Minor authors are foreigners in their own tongue. If they are bastards, if they experience themselves as bastards, it is due not to a mixing or intermingling of lan guages but rather to a subtraction and variation of their own language achieved by stretching tensors through it. The notion *of minority *is very complex, with musical, literary, linguis tic, as well as juridical and political, references. The opposition between minority and majority is not simply quantitative. Majority implies a con stant, of expression or content, serving as a standard measure by which to evaluate it. Let us suppose that the constant or standard is the average adult-white-heterosexual-European-male-speaking a standard language (Joyce's or Ezra Pound's Ulysses). It is obvious that "man" holds the majority, even if he is less numerous than mosquitoes, children, women, blacks, peasants, homosexuals, etc. That is because he appears twice, once in the constant and again in the variable from which the constant is extracted. Majority assumes a state of power and domination, not the other way around. It assumes the standard measure, not the other way around. Even Marxism "has almost always translated hegemony from the point of view of the national worker, qualified, male and over thirty-five." 40 A determination different from that of the constant will therefore be consid ered minoritarian, by nature and regardless of number, in other words, a subsystem or an outsystem. This is evident in all the operations, electoral or otherwise, where you are given a choice, but on the condition that your choice conform to the limits of the constant ("you mustn't choose to change society..."). But at this point, everything is reversed. For the majority, insofar as it is analytically included in the abstract standard, is never anybody, it is always Nobody—Ulysses—whereas the minority is the becoming of everybody, one's potential becoming to the extent that one deviates from the model. There is a majoritarian "fact," but it is the ana lytic fact of Nobody, as opposed to the becoming-minoritarian of every body. That is why we must distinguish between: the majoritarian as a constant and homogeneous system; minorities as subsystems; and the

0 106 □ NOVEMBER 20, 1923: POSTULATES OF LINGUISTICS minoritarian as a potential, creative and created, becoming. The problem is never to acquire the majority, even in order to install a new constant. There is no becoming-majoritarian; majority is never becoming. All becoming is minoritarian. Women, regardless of their numbers, are a minority, definable as a state or subset; but they create only by making pos sible a becoming over which they do not have ownership, into which they themselves must enter; this is a becoming-woman affecting all of human kind, men and women both. The same goes for minor languages: they are not simply sublanguages, idiolects or dialects, but potential agents of the major language's entering into a becoming-minoritarian of all of its dimen sions and elements. We should distinguish between minor languages, the major language, and the becoming-minor of the major language. Minori ties, of course, are objectively definable states, states of language, ethnicity, or sex with their own ghetto territorialities, but they must also be thought of as seeds, crystals of becoming whose value is to trigger uncontrollable movements and deterritorializations of the mean or majority. That is why Pasolini demonstrated that the essential thing, precisely in free indirect discourse, is to be found neither in language A, nor in language B, but "in language X, which is none other than language A in the actual process of becoming language B." 41 There is a universal figure of minoritarian con sciousness as the becoming of everybody, and that becoming is creation. One does not attain it by acquiring the majority. The figure to which we are referring is continuous variation, as an amplitude that continually over steps the representative threshold of the majoritarian standard, by excess or default. In erecting the figure of a universal minoritarian consciousness, one addresses powers *(puissances) *of becoming that belong to a different realm from that of Power *(Pouvoir) *and Domination. Continuous variation constitutes the becoming-minoritarian of everybody, as opposed to the majoritarian Fact of Nobody. Becoming-minoritarian as the universal fig ure of consciousness is called autonomy. It is certainly not by using a minor language as a dialect, by regionalizing or ghettoizing, that one becomes revolutionary; rather, by using a number of minority elements, by connect ing, conjugating them, one invents a specific, unforeseen, autonomous be coming. 42 The major and minor mode are two different treatments of language, one of which consists in extracting constants from it, the other in placing it in continuous variation. The order-word is the variable of enunciation that effectuates the condition of possibility of language and defines the usage of its elements according to one of the two treatments; we must therefore return to it as the only "metalanguage" capable of accounting for this dou ble direction, this double treatment of variables. The problem of the func tions of language is in general poorly formulated because this order-word

0 NOVEMBER 20, 1923: POSTULATES OF LINGUISTICS □ 107 variable, which subsumes all possible functions, is overlooked. Following Canetti's suggestions, we may begin from the following pragmatic situa tion: the order-word is a death sentence; it always implies a death sentence, even if it has been considerably softened, becoming symbolic, initiatory, temporary, etc. Order-words bring immediate death to those who receive the order, or potential death if they do not obey, or a death they must them selves inflict, take elsewhere. A father's orders to his son, "You will do this," "You will not do that," cannot be separated from the little death sen tence the son experiences on a point of his person. Death, death; it is the only judgment, and it is what makes judgment a system. The verdict. *But  the order-word is also something else, *inseparably connected: it is like a warning cry or a message to flee. It would be oversimplifying to say that flight is a reaction against the order-word; rather, it is included in it, as its other face in a complex assemblage, its other component. Canetti is right to invoke the lion's roar, which enunciates flight and death simultaneously. 43 The order-word has two tones. The prophet receives order-words just as much in taking flight as in longing for death: Jewish prophetism fused the wish to be dead and the flight impulse with the divine order-word. Now if we consider the first aspect of the order-word, in other words, death as the expressed of the statement, it clearly meets the preceding requirements: even though death essentially concerns bodies, is attributed to bodies, its immediacy, its instantaneousness, lends it the authentic char acter of an incorporeal transformation. What precedes and follows it may be an extensive system of actions and passions, a slow labor of bodies; in itself, it is neither action nor passion, but a pure act, a pure transformation that enunciation fuses with the statement, the sentence. That man is dead ... You are already dead when you receive the order-word ... In effect, death is everywhere, as that ideal, uncrossable boundary separating bod ies, their forms, and states, and as the condition, even initiatory, even sym bolic, through which a subject must pass in order to change its form or state. This is the sense in which Canetti speaks of "enantiomorphosis": 44 a regime that involves a hieratic and immutable Master who at every moment legislates by constants, prohibiting or strictly limiting metamor phoses, giving figures clear and stable contours, setting forms in opposi tion two by two and requiring subjects to die in order to pass from one form to the other. It is always by means of something incorporeal that a body sep arates and distinguishes itself from another. The figure, insofar as it is the extremity of a body, is the noncorporeal attribute that limits and completes that body: death is the Figure. It is through death that a body reaches com pletion not only in time but in space, and it is through death that its lines form or outline a shape. There are dead spaces just as there are dead times. "If [enantiomorphosis is] practiced often the whole world shrivels....

0 108 □ NOVEMBER 20, 1923: POSTULATES OF LINGUISTICS Social prohibitions against metamorphosis are perhaps the most impor tant of all. . . . Death itself, the strictest of all boundaries, is what is inter posed between classes." 45 In a regime of this kind, any new body requires the erection of an opposable form, as well as the formation of distinct sub jects; death is the general incorporeal transformation attributed to all bod ies from the standpoint of their forms and substances (for example, the body of the Party cannot come into its own without an operation of enantiomorphosis, and without the formation of new activists, which assumes the elimination of the first generation). It is true that we are bringing in considerations of content as well as expression. For even at the moment when the two planes are most distinct, as the regime of bodies and the regime of signs in an assemblage, they are still in reciprocal presupposition. The incorporeal transformation is the expressed of order-words, but also the attribute of bodies. Not only do lin guistic variables of expression enter into relations of formal opposition or distinction favorable to the extraction of constants; nonlinguistic variables of content do also. As Hjelmslev notes, an expression is divided, for exam ple, into phonic units in the same way a content is divided into social, zoo logical, or physical units ("calf divides into young-bovine-male). 46 The network of binarities, or arborescences, is applicable to both sides. There is, however, no analytic resemblance, correspondence, or conformity between the two planes. But their independence does not preclude isomor phism, in other words, the existence of the same kind of constant relations on both sides. It is by virtue of this type of relations that linguistic and nonlinguistic elements are inseparable from the start, despite their absence of correspondence. The elements of content give the interminglings of bod ies clear contours at the same time as the elements of expression give the noncorporeal expresseds a power of sentencing or judgment. These ele ments are all abstract or deterritorialized to different degrees, but in each instance they effect a reterritorialization of the overall assemblage on cer tain order-words and contours. Indeed, the significance of the doctrine of synthetic judgment is to have demonstrated that there is an a priori link (isomorphism) between Sentence and Figure, form of expression and form of content. If we consider the other aspect of the order-word, flight rather than death, it appears that variables are in a new state, that of continuous varia tion. An incorporeal transformation is still attributed to bodies, but it is now a passage to the limit: that is the only way, not to eliminate death, but to reduce it or make it a variation itself. This movement pushes language to its own limits, while bodies are simultaneously caught up in a movement of metamorphosis of their contents or a process of exhaustion causing them to reach or overstep the limit of their figures. This is an appropriate place to

0 NOVEMBER 20, 1923: POSTULATES OF LINGUISTICS □ 109 bring up the opposition between minor sciences and major sciences: for example, the tendency of the broken line to become a curve, a whole opera tive geometry of the trait and movement, a pragmatic science of placings-in-variation that operates in a different manner than the royal or major science of Euclid's invariants and travels a long history of suspicion and even repression (we will return to this question later). 47 The smallest interval is always diabolical: the master of metamorphoses is opposed to the invariant hieratic king. It is as though an intense matter or a continuum of variation were freed, here in the internal tensors of language, there in the internal tensions of content. The idea of the smallest interval does not apply to figures of the same nature; it implies at least a curve and a straight line, a circle and a tangent. We witness a transformation of substances and a dissolution of forms, a passage to the limit or flight from contours in favor of fluid forces, flows, air, light, and matter, such that a body or a word does not end at a precise point. We witness the incorporeal power of that intense matter, the material power of that language. A matter more immediate, more fluid, and more ardent than bodies or words. In continuous variation the relevant distinction is no longer between a form of expression and a form of content but between two inseparable planes in reciprocal presupposition. The relativity of the distinction between them is now fully realized on the plane of consistency, where the assemblage is swept up by a now absolute deterritorialization. Absolute, however, does not mean undifferentiated: differences, now "infinitely small," are constituted in a single matter serving both for expression as incorporeal power and for content as limitless corporeality. The relation of presupposition between variables of content and expression no longer requires two forms: the placing-in-variation of the variables instead draws the two forms together and effects the conjunction of cutting edges of deterritorialization on both sides; this occurs on the plane of a single liberated matter that contains no figures, is deliberately unformed, and retains in expression and in content only those cutting edges, tensors, and tensions. Gestures and things, voices and sounds, are caught up in the same "opera," swept away by the same shifting effects of stammering, vibrato, tremolo, and overspilling. A syn thesizer places all of the parameters in continuous variation, gradually making "fundamentally heterogeneous elements end up turning into each other in some way." The moment this conjunction occurs there is a com mon matter. It is only at this point that one reaches the abstract machine, or the diagram of the assemblage. The synthesizer has replaced judgment, and matter has replaced the figure or formed substance. It is no longer even appropriate to group biological, physicochemical, and energetic intensi ties on the one hand, and mathematical, aesthetic, linguistic, informa tional, semiotic intensities, etc., on the other.

For the question was not how to elude the order-word but how to elude the death sentence it envelops, how to develop its power of escape, how to prevent escape from veering into the imaginary or falling into a black hole, how to maintain or draw out the revolutionary potentiality of the order-word. Hofmannsthal adopts the order-word, "Germany, Ger many!", or the need to reterritorialize, even in a "melancholy mirror." But beneath this order-word he hears another, as if the old German "figures" were mere constants that were then effaced to uncover a relation with nature and life all the more profound for being variable. When should this relation to life be a hardening, when submission? At what moment is rebel lion called for and at what moment surrender or impassibility? When is dry speech necessary and when exuberance or amusement? 48 Whatever the breaks and ruptures, only continuous variation brings forth this virtual line, this virtual continuum of life, "the essential element of the real beneath the everyday." There is a splendid statement in one of Herzog's films. The main character asks himself a question and then says, Who will answer this answer? Actually, there is no question, answers are all one ever answers. To the answer already contained in a question (cross-exam ination, competition, plebiscite, etc.) one should respond with questions from another answer. One should bring forth the order-word of the order-word. In the order-word, life must answer the answer of death, not by fleeing, but by making flight act and create. There are pass-words beneath order-words. Words that pass, words that are components of passage, whereas order-words mark stoppages or organized, stratified composi tions. A single thing or word undoubtedly has this twofold nature: it is nec essary to extract one from the other—to transform the compositions of order into components of passage.

A regime of signs constitutes a semiotic  system. But it appears difficult to analyze semiotic systems in themselves:  there is always a form of content that is simultaneously inseparable from  and independent of the form of expression, and the two forms pertain to  assemblages that are not principally linguistic. However, one can proceed  as though the formalization of expression were autonomous and  self-sufficient. Even if that is done, there is such diversity in the forms of  expression, such a mixture of these forms, that it is impossible to attach  any particular privilege to the form or regime of the "signifier." If we call  the signifying semiotic system semiology, then semiology is only one  regime of signs among others, and not the most important one. Hence the  necessity of a return to pragmatics, in which language never has universal-  ity in itself, self-sufficient formalization, a general semiology, or a meta m

0 112 □ 587 B.c.-A.D. 70: ON SEVERAL REGIMES OF SIGNS language. Thus it is the study of the signifying regime that first testifies to the inadequacy of linguistic presuppositions, and in the very name of regimes of signs. There is a simple general formula for the signifying regime of the sign (the signifying sign): every sign refers to another sign, and only to another sign, ad infinitum. That is why, at the limit, one can forgo the notion of the sign, for what is retained is not principally the sign's relation to a state of things it designates, or to an entity it signifies, but only the formal relation of sign to sign insofar as it defines a so-called signifying chain. The limitlessness of signifiance replaces the sign. When denotation (here, des ignation and signification taken together) is assumed to be part of connota tion, one is wholly within this signifying regime of the sign. Not much attention is paid to *indexes, *in other words, the territorial states of things constituting the designatable. Not much attention is paid to *icons, *that is, operations of reterritorialization constituting the signifiable. Thus the sign has already attained a high degree of relative deterritorialization; it is thought of as a *symbol *in a constant movement of referral from sign to sign. The signifier is the sign in redundancy with the sign. All signs are signs of signs. The question is not yet what a given sign signifies but to which other signs it refers, or which signs add themselves to it to form a network with out beginning or end that projects its shadow onto an amorphous atmo spheric continuum. It is this amorphous continuum that for the moment plays the role of the "signified," but it continually glides beneath the signifier, for which it serves only as a medium or wall: the specific forms of all contents dissolve in it. The atmospherization or mundanization of con tents. Contents are abstracted. This is the situation Levi-Strauss describes: the world begins to signify before anyone knows *what *it signifies; the signi fied is given without being known. 1 Your wife looked at you with a funny expression. And this morning the mailman handed you a letter from the IRS and crossed his fingers. Then you stepped in a pile of dog shit. You saw two sticks on the sidewalk positioned like the hands of a watch. They were whispering behind your back when you arrived at the office. It doesn't mat ter what it means, it's still signifying. The sign that refers to other signs is struck with a strange impotence and uncertainty, but mighty is the signifier that constitutes the chain. The paranoiac shares this impotence of the deterritorialized sign assailing him from every direction in the gliding atmosphere, but that only gives him better access to the superpower of the signifier, through the royal feeling of wrath, as master of the network spreading through the atmosphere. The paranoid despotic regime: they are attacking me and making me suffer, but I can guess what they're up to, I'm one step ahead of them, I've always known, I have power even in my impo tence. "I'll get them."

0 587 B.c.-AD. 70: ON SEVERAL REGIMES OF SIGNS D 113 Nothing is ever over and done with in a regime of this kind. It's made for that, it's the tragic regime of infinite debt, to which one is simultaneously debtor and creditor. A sign refers to another sign, into which it passes and which carries it into still other signs. "To the point that it returns in a circu lar fashion ..." Not only do signs form an infinite network, but the net work of signs is infinitely circular. The statement survives its object, the name survives its owner. Whether it passes into other signs or is kept in reserve for a time, the sign survives both its state of things and its signified; it leaps like an animal or a dead person to regain its place in the chain and invest a new state, a new signified, from which it will in turn extricate itself. 2 A hint of the eternal return. There is a whole regime of roving, float ing statements, suspended names, signs lying in wait to return and be propelled by the chain. The signifier as the self-redundancy of the deterri-torialized sign, a funereal world of terror. But what counts is less this circularity of signs than the multiplicity of the circles or chains. The sign refers not only to other signs in the same cir cle, but to signs in other circles or spirals as well. Robert Lowie describes how Crow and Hopi men react differently when their wives cheat on them (the Crow are nomadic hunters and the Hopi sedentaries with an imperial tradition): "A Crow Indian whose wife has cheated on him slashes her face, whereas the Hopi who has fallen victim to the same misfortune, without losing his calm, withdraws and prays for drought and famine to descend on the village." It is easy to see where the paranoia resides, the despotic ele ment or signifying regime, or again, as Levi-Strauss says, "the bigotry": "In effect, for a Hopi everything is connected: a social disturbance or a domes tic incident calls into question the system of the universe, the levels of which are united by multiple correspondences; a disruption on one plane is only intelligible, and morally tolerable, as a projection of other disruptions involving other levels." 3 The Hopi jump from one circle to another, or from one sign to another on a different spiral. One leaves the village or the city, only to return. The jumps may be regulated not only by presignifying ritu als but also by a whole imperial bureaucracy passing judgment on their legitimacy. The jumps are not made at random, they are not without rules. Not only are they regulated, but some are prohibited: Do not overstep the outermost circle, do not approach the innermost circle .. . There is a dis tinction between circles because, although all signs refer to each other only to the extent that they are deterritorialized, oriented toward the same cen ter of signifiance, distributed throughout an amorphous continuum, they have different speeds of deterritorialization attesting to a place of origin (temple, palace, house, street, village, bush, etc.), and they have differential relations maintaining the distinction between circles or constituting thresholds in the atmosphere of the continuum (private and public, family

Deception is fundamental to the system. Jumping from circle to circle, always moving the scene, playing it out somewhere else: such is the hysteric operation of the deceiver as sub ject, answering to the paranoid operation of the despot installed in his cen ter of signifiance. There is one other aspect: the signifying regime is not simply faced with the task of organizing into circles signs emitted from every direction; it must constantly assure the expansion of the circles or spiral, it must pro vide the center with more signifier to overcome the entropy inherent in the system and to make new circles blossom or replenish the old. Thus a secon dary mechanism in the service of signifiance is necessary: interpretance or interpretation. This time the signifier assumes a new figure: it is no longer the amorphous continuum that is given without being known and across which the network of signs is strung. A portion of signified is made to corre spond to a sign or group of signs for which that signified has been deemed suitable, thus making it knowable. To the syntagmatic axis of the sign refer ring to other signs is added a paradigmatic axis on which the sign, thus for malized, fashions for itself a suitable signified (once again there is abstraction of the content, but in a new way). The interpretive priest, the seer, is one of the despot-god's bureaucrats. A new aspect of deception arises, the deception of the priest: interpretation is carried to infinity and never encounters anything to interpret that is not already itself an interpre tation. The signified constantly reimparts signifier, recharges it or pro duces more of it. The form always comes from the signifier. The ultimate signified is therefore the signifier itself, in its redundancy or "excess." It is perfectly futile to claim to transcend interpretation or even communica tion through the production of signifier, because communication and interpretation are what always serve to reproduce and produce signifier. That is certainly not the way to revive the notion of production. The dis covery of the psychoanalyst-priests (a discovery every kind of priest or seer made in their time) was that interpretation had to be subordinated to signifiance, to the point that the signifier would impart no signified with out the signified reimparting signifier in its turn. Actually, there is no longer even any need to interpret, but that is because the best interpreta tion, the weightiest and most radical one, is an eminently significant silence. It is well known that although psychoanalysts have ceased to speak, they interpret even more, or better yet, fuel interpretation on the part of the subject, who jumps from one circle of hell to the next. In truth, signifiance and interpretosis are the two diseases of the earth or the skin, in other words, humankind's fundamental neurosis. There is not much to say about the center of signifiance, or the Signifier

It comes to the same thing to say that the sign refers to other signs ad infinitum and that the infinite set of all signs refers to a supreme signifier. At any rate, this pure formal redundancy of the signifier could not even be conceptualized if it did not have its own substance of expression, for which we must find a name: *faciality. *Not only is language always accompanied by faciality traits, but the face crystallizes all redundancies, it emits and receives, releases and recaptures signifying signs. It is a whole body unto itself: it is like the body of the center of signifiance to which all of the deterritorialized signs affix themselves, and it marks the limit of their deterritorialization. The voice emanates from the face; that is why, however fundamentally important the writing machine is in the imperial bureaucracy, what is writ ten retains an oral or nonbook character. The face is the Icon proper to the signifying regime, the reterritorialization internal to the system. The signifier reterritorializes on the face. The face is what gives the signifier substance; it is what fuels interpretation, and it is what changes, changes traits, when interpretation reimparts signifier to its substance. Look, his expression changed. The signifier is always facialized. Faciality reigns materially over that whole constellation of signifiances and interpretations (psychologists have written extensively on the baby's relations to the moth er's face, and sociologists on the role of the face in mass media and adver tising). The despot-god has never hidden his face, far from it: he makes himself one, or even several. The mask does not hide the face, it *is *the face. The priest administers the face of the god. With the despot, everything is public, and everything that is public is so by virtue of the face. Lies and deception may be a fundamental part of the signifying regime, but secrecy is not. 4 Conversely, when the face is effaced, when the faciality traits dis appear, we can be sure that we have entered another regime, other zones infinitely muter and more imperceptible where subterranean becomings-animal occur, becomings-molecular, nocturnal deterritorializations over-spilling the limits of the signifying system. The despot or god brandishes the solar face that is his entire body, as the body of the signifier. He looked at me queerly, he knitted his brow, what did I do to make him change expression? I have her picture in front of me, it's as if she were watching me ... Surveillance by the face, as Strindberg said. Overcoding by the signifier, irradiation in all directions, unlocalized omnipresence. Finally, the face or body of the despot or god has something like a counterbody: the body of the tortured, or better, of the excluded. There is no question that these two bodies communicate, for the body of the despot is sometimes subjected to trials of humiliation or even torture, or of exile and exclusion. "At the opposite pole one might imagine placing the body of

In the darkest region of the political field the condemned man outlines the symmetrical, inverted fig ure of the king." 5 The one who is tortured is fundamentally one who loses his or her face, entering into a becoming-animal, a becoming-molecular the ashes of which are thrown to the wind. But it appears that the one who is tortured is not at all the final term, but rather the first step before exclu sion. Oedipus, at least, understood that. He tortured himself, gouged out his own eyes, then went away. The rite, the becoming-animal of the scape goat clearly illustrates this: a first expiatory animal is sacrificed, but a sec ond is driven away, sent out into the desert wilderness. In the signifying regime, the scapegoat represents a new form of increasing entropy in the system of signs: it is charged with everything that was "bad" in a given period, that is, everything that resisted signifying signs, everything that eluded the referral from sign to sign through the different circles; it also assumes everything that was unable to recharge the signifier at its center and carries off everything that spills beyond the outermost circle. Finally, and especially, it incarnates that line of flight the signifying regime cannot tolerate, in other words, an absolute deterritorialization; the regime must block a line of this kind or define it in an entirely negative fashion precisely because it exceeds the degree of deterritorialization of the signifying sign, however high it may be. The line of flight is like a tangent to the circles of signifiance and the center of the signifier. It is under a curse. The goat's anus stands opposite the face of the despot or god. Anything that threatens to put the system to flight will be killed or put to flight itself. Anything that exceeds the excess of the signifier or passes beneath it will be marked with a negative value. Your only choice will be between a goat's ass and the face of the god, between sorcerers and priests. The complete system, then, consists of the paranoid face or body of the despot-god in the signifying center of the temple; the interpreting priests who continually recharge the signified in the temple, transforming it into signifier; the hysterical crowd of people outside, clumped in tight circles, who jump from one circle to another; the faceless, depressive scapegoat emanating from the center, chosen, treated, and adorned by the priests, cutting across the circles in its headlong flight into the desert. This excessively hasty overview is applicable not only to the imperial despotic regime but to all subjected, arborescent, hierarchical, centered groups: political parties, literary movements, psychoanalytic associations, families, conjugal units, etc. The photo, faciality, redun dancy, signifiance, and interpretation are at work everywhere.

The signifier reigns over every domestic squabble, and in every State apparatus. The signifying regime of the sign is defined by eight aspects or princi ples: (1) the sign refers to another sign, ad infinitum (the limitlessness of signifiance, which deterritorializes the sign); (2) the sign is brought back by other signs and never ceases to return (the circularity of the deterrito-rialized sign); (3) the sign jumps from circle to circle and constantly displaces the center at the same time as it ties into it (the metaphor or hysteria of signs); (4) the expansion of the circles is assured by interpretations that impart signified and reimpart signifier (the interpretosis of the priest); (5) the infinite set of signs refers to a supreme signifier presenting itself as both lack and excess (the despotic signifier, the limit of the system's deterrito-rialization); (6) the form of the signifier has a substance, or the signifier has a body, namely, the Face (the principle of faciality traits, which constitute a reterritorialization); (7) the system's line of flight is assigned a negative value, condemned as that which exceeds the signifying regime's power of deterritorialization (the principle of the scapegoat); (8) the regime is one of universal deception, in its jumps, in the regulated circles, in the seer's regulation of interpretations, in the publicness of the facialized center, and in the treatment of the line of flight. Not only is this semiotic system not the first, but we see no reason to accord it any particular privilege from the standpoint of an abstract evolu tionism. We would like to indicate very briefly certain characteristics of the other two semiotic systems. First, the so-called primitive, *presignifying  semiotic, *which is much closer to "natural" codings operating without signs. There is no reduction to faciality as the sole substance of expression: there is no elimination of forms of content through abstraction of the signi fied. To the extent that there is still abstraction of content from a strictly semiotic point of view, it fosters a pluralism or polyvocality of forms of expression that prevents any power takeover by the signifier and preserves expressive forms particular to content; thus forms of corporeality, gesturality, rhythm, dance, and rite coexist heterogeneously with the vocal form. 6 A variety of forms and substances of expression intersect and form relays. It is a segmentary but plurilinear, multidimensional semiotic that wards off any kind of signifying circularity. Segmentarity is the law of the lineages. Here, the sign owes its degree of relative deterritorialization not to a perpetual referral to other signs but rather to a confrontation between the territorialities and compared segments from which each sign is extracted (the camp, the bush, the moving of the camp). Not only is the polyvocality of statements preserved, but it is possible to finish with a statement: A name that has been used up is abolished, a situation quite

0 118 □ 587 B.C.-A.D. 70: ON SEVERAL REGIMES OF SIGNS unlike the placing in reserve or transformation occurring in the signifying semiotic. The meaning of cannibalism in a presignifying regime is pre cisely this: eating the name, a semiography that is fully a part of a semiotic in spite of its relation to content (the relation is an expressive one). 7 It should not be thought that a semiotic of this kind functions by ignorance, repression, or foreclosure of the signifier. On the contrary, it is animated by a keen presentiment of what is to come. It does not need to understand it to fight against it. It is wholly destined by its very segmentarity and poly-vocality to avert the already-present threat: universalizing abstraction, erection of the signifier, circularity of statements, and their correlates, the State apparatus, the instatement of the despot, the priestly caste, the scapegoat, etc. Every time they eat a dead man, they can say: one more the State won't get. There is another semiotic, the *countersignifying *semiotic (whose most notable representatives are the fearsome, warlike, and animal-raising nomads, as opposed to hunter nomads, who belong to the previous semiotic). This time, the semiotic proceeds less by segmentarity than by arithmetic and numeration. Of course, the number already played a role of great importance in the division and union of segmentary lineages; it also had a function of decisive importance in the signifying imperial bureau cracy. But that was a kind of number that represented or signified, a num ber "incited, produced, caused by something other than itself." On the contrary, a numerical sign that is not produced by something outside the system of marking it institutes, which marks a mobile and plural distribu tion, which itself determines functions and relations, which arrives at arrangements rather than totals, distributions rather than collections, which operates more by breaks, transitions, migration, and accumulation than by combining units—a sign of this kind would appear to belong to the semiotic of a nomad war machine directed against the State apparatus. The numbering number. 8 Its numerical organization into tens, fifties, hun dreds, thousands, etc., and the associated spatial organization were obvi ously adopted by State armies, but basically bear witness to a military system specific to the great nomads of the steppes, from the Hyksos to the Mongols. They were superposed upon the principle of lineage. Secrecy and spying are important elements of the war machine's semiotic of Numbers. The role of Numbers in the Bible is not unrelated to the nomads, since Moses got the idea from his father-in-law, Jethro the Kenite: he used it as an organizational principle for the march and migration, and applied it him self to the military domain. In this countersignifying regime, the imperial despotic line of flight is replaced by a line of abolition that turns back against the great empires, cuts across them and destroys them, or else con quers them and integrates with them to form a mixed semiotic.

0 587 B.c.-AD. 70: ON SEVERAL REGIMES OF SIGNS D 119 We would like to go into greater detail on a fourth regime of signs, the *postsignifying *regime, which has different characteristics opposing it to signifiance and is defined by a unique procedure, that of "subjecti-fication." There are many regimes of signs. Our own list is arbitrarily limited. There is no reason to identify a regime or a semiotic system with a people or historical moment. There is such mixture within the same period or the same people that we can say no more than that a given people, language, or period assures the relative dominance of a certain regime. Perhaps all semiotics are mixed and not only combine with various forms of content but also combine different regimes of signs. Presignifying elements are always active in the signifying regime; countersignifying elements are always present and at work within it; and postsignifying elements are already there. Even that is to mark too much temporality. The semiotics and their mixtures may appear in a history of confrontation and inter mingling of peoples, but also in languages in which there are several com peting functions, or in a psychiatric hospital in which different forms of insanity coexist among the patients or even combine in a single patient; or in an ordinary conversation in which people are speaking the same tongue but different languages (all of a sudden a fragment of an unex pected semiotic surfaces). We are not suggesting an evolutionism, we are not even doing history. Semiotic systems depend on assemblages, and it is the assemblages that determine that a given people, period, or language, and even a given style, fashion, pathology, or minuscule event in a limited situation, can assure the predominance of one semiotic or another. We are trying to make maps of regimes of signs: we can turn them around or retain selected coordinates or dimensions, and depending on the case we will be dealing with a social formation, a pathological delusion *(d'elire), *a historical event, etc. We will see this on another occasion when we deal with a dated social system, "courtly love," and then switch to a private enterprise called "masochism." We can also combine maps or separate them. To make the distinction between two types of semiotics (for exam ple, the postsignifying regime and the signifying regime), we must con sider very diverse domains simultaneously. In the first years of the twentieth century, psychiatry, at the height of its clinical skills, confronted the problem of nonhallucinatory delusions in which mental integrity is retained without "intellectual diminishment." There was a first major grouping, paranoid or interpretive delusions, which already subsumed various aspects. But the question of the possible independence of another group was prefigured in Esquirol's monomania and Kraepelin's querulous delusion, and later defined by Serieux and Capgras as grievance delusion, and by Clerambault as passional delusion

0 120 □ 587 B.C.-A.D. 70: ON SEVERAL REGIMES OF SIGNS ("querulousness or seeking redress, jealousy, erotomania"). Basing our selves on very fine studies of Serieux and Capgras on the one hand, and Clerambault on the other (the latter took the distinction furthest), we will contrast a paranoid-interpretive ideal regime of signifiance with a passional, postsignifying subjective regime. The first regime is defined by an insidious onset and a hidden center bearing witness to endogenous forces organized around an idea; by the development of a network stretch ing across an amorphous continuum, a gliding atmosphere into which the slightest incident may be carried; by an organization of radiating circles expanding by circular irradiation in all directions, and in which the indi vidual jumps from one point to another, one circle to another, approaches the center then moves away, operates prospectively and retrospectively; and by a transformation of the atmosphere, as a function of variable traits or secondary centers clustered around a principal nucleus. The second regime, on the contrary, is defined by a decisive external occurrence, by a relation with the outside that is expressed more as an emotion than an idea, and more as effort or action than imagination ("active delusion rather than ideational delusion"); by a limited constellation operating in a single sec tor; by a "postulate" or "concise formula" serving as the point of departure for a linear series or proceeding that runs its course, at which point a new proceeding begins. In short, it operates *by the linear and temporal succes-  sion of finite proceedings, rather than by the simultaneity of circles in unlim-  ited expansion.* *9* This story of two kinds of delusions without intellectual diminishment is of great importance. For it is not a disruption of a preexisting discipline of psychiatry; it lies at the heart of the constitution of the psychiatrist in the nineteenth century and explains why he or she was from the start what he or she has been ever since: the psychiatrist was born cornered, caught between legal, police, humanitarian demands, accused of not being a true doctor, suspected of mistaking the sane for mad and the mad for sane, prey to quandaries of conscience, the last Hegelian *belle ame. *If we consider the two types of intact delusions, we can say that people in the first group seem to be completely mad, but aren't: President Schreber developed his radiat ing paranoia and relations with God in every direction, but he was not mad in that he remained capable of managing his wealth wisely and distinguish ing between circles. At the other pole are those who do not seem mad in any way, but are, as borne out by their sudden actions, such as quarrels, arsons, murders (Esquirol's four great monomanias, erotic, intellectual, arson, and homocidal, already belong in this category). In short, psychiatry was not at all constituted in relation to the concept of madness, or even as a modification of that concept, but rather by *its split in these two opposite  directions. *And is it not our own double image, all of ours, that psychiatry

(This twofold assertion is also psychoanalysis's point of departure, its way of linking into psychiatry: we seem to be mad but aren't, observe the dream; we are mad but don't seem to be, observe everyday life.) Thus psy chiatrists were alternately in the position of on the one hand pleading for tolerance and understanding, underscoring the uselessness of confine ment, appealing for open-door asylums; and on the other arguing for stepped-up surveillance and special high-security asylums, stricter mea sures necessitated by the fact that the mad seemed not to be. 10 Is it by chance that the distinction between the two major kinds of delusions, idea tional and active, in many ways recapitulates the distinction between the classes (paranoiacs do not particularly need to be committed, they are usu ally bourgeois, whereas monomaniacs, passional redress-seekers, are most often from the working and rural classes, or are marginal, as in the case of political assassins).'' A class with radiant, irradiating ideas (but of course!) against a class reduced to linear, sporadic, partial, local actions ... All par anoiacs are not bourgeois, all passionals or monomaniacs are not proletar ian. But God and his psychiatrists are charged with recognizing, among these de facto mixes, those who preserve, even in delusion, the class-based social order, and those who sow disorder, even strictly localized, such as haystack fires, parental murders, declasse love and aggression. We are trying, then, to make a distinction between a paranoid, signify ing, despotic regime of signs and a passional or subjective, postsignifying, authoritarian regime. Authoritarian is assuredly not the same as despotic, passional is not the same as paranoid, and subjective is not the same as sig nifying. What happens in the second regime, by comparison with the signi fying regime as we have already defined it? In the first place, *a sign or  packet of signs detaches from the irradiating circular network *and sets to work on its own account, starts running a straight line, as though swept into a narrow, open passage. Already the signifying system drew a line of flight or deterritorialization exceeding the specific index of its deterritorialized signs, but the system gave that line a negative value and sent the scapegoat fleeing down it. Here, it seems that the line receives a positive sign, as though it were effectively occupied and followed by a people who find in it their reason for being or destiny. Once again, we are not, of course, doing history: we are not saying that a people invents this regime of signs, only that at a given moment a people effectuates the assemblage that assures the relative dominance of that regime under certain historical conditions (and that regime, that dominance, that assemblage may be assured under other conditions, for example, pathological, literary, romantic, or entirely mun dane). We are not saying that a people is possessed by a given type of delusion but that the map of a delusion, its coordinates considered, may

In the case of the Jewish people, a group of signs detaches from the Egyptian imperial network of which it was a part and sets off down a line of flight into the desert, pitting the most authoritarian of subjectivities against despotic signifiance, the most passional and least interpretive of delusions against interpretational paranoid delusion, in short, a linear "proceeding and grievance" against the irradiating circular network. *Your grievance, your proceeding: *that is Moses' word to his people, and the proceedings come one after the other along a line of Passion. 12 From this Kafka derives his own conception of querulousness or the proceeding, and the succession of linear segments: the father-proceeding, hotel-proceeding, ship-proceeding, court-pro ceeding . .. We cannot overlook the most fundamental or extensive event in the his tory of the Jewish people: the destruction of the Temple, in two stages (587 B.C. and A.D. 70). The whole history of the Temple—the mobility and fra gility of the ark, then the construction of a House by Solomon, its recon struction under Darius, etc.—has meaning only in relation to renewed proceedings of destruction, the two supreme moments of which came with Nebuchadnezzar and Titus. A temple, mobile, fragile, or destroyed: the ark is no more than a little portable packet of signs. An entirely negative line of flight occupied by the animal or scapegoat laden with all the dangers threatening the signifier has become an impossibility. Let misfortune befall us: this formula punctuates Jewish history. It is we who must follow the most deterritorialized line, the line of the scapegoat, but we will change its sign, we will turn it into the positive line of our subjectivity, our Passion, our proceeding or grievance. We will be our own scapegoat. We will be the lamb: "The God who, like a lion, was given blood sacrifice must be shoved into the background, and the sacrificed god must occupy the foreground. ... God became the animal that was slain, instead of the animal that does the slaying." 13 We will follow, we will wed the tangent separating the land from the waters, we will separate the circular network from the gliding continuum, we will make the line of separation our own, in order to forge our path along it and dissociate the elements of the signifier (the dove of the ark). A narrow line of march, an in-between that is not a mean but a slender line. There is a Jewish specificity, immediately affirmed in a semiotic system. This semiotic, however, is no less mixed than any other. On the one hand, it is intimately related to the countersignifying regime of the nomads (the Hebrews had a nomadic past, a continuing relationship with the nomadic numerical organization that inspired them, and their own particular becoming-nomad; their line of deterritorialization owed much to the military line of nomadic destruction). 14 On the other hand, it

0 587 B.c.-A.D. 70: ON SEVERAL REGIMES OF SIGNS □ 123 has an essential relation to the signifying semiotic itself, for which the Hebrews and their God would always be nostalgic: reestablish an imperial society and integrate with it, enthrone a king like everybody else (Samuel), rebuild a temple that would finally be solid (David and Solomon, Zachariah), erect the spiral of the Tower of Babel and find the face of God again; not just bring the wandering to a halt, but overcome the diaspora, which itself exists only as a function of an ideal regathering. We only have space to indicate what, in this mixed semiotic, bears witness to the new postsignifying subjective or passional regime. Faciality undergoes a profound transformation. The god averts his face, which must be seen by no one; and the subject, gripped by a veritable fear of the god, averts his or her face in turn. The averted faces, in profile, replace the frontal view of the radiant face. It is this double turning away that draws the positive line of flight. The prophet is the main figure in this assemblage; he needs a sign to guarantee the word of God, he is himself marked by a sign indicating the special regime to which he belongs. It is Spinoza who has elaborated the profoundest theory of prophetism, taking into account the semiotic proper to it. Cain, who turns away from the God who turns away from him, already follows the line of deterritorialization, protected by a sign allowing him to escape death. The mark of Cain. A punishment worse than imperial death? The Jewish God invented the reprieve, existence in reprieve, *indefinite postponement.* *15* * *But He also invented the positivity of alliance, or the covenant, as the new relation with the deity, since the sub ject remains alive. Abel, whose name is vanity, is nothing; Cain is the true man. This is very different from the system of rigging or deception animat ing the face of the signifier, the interpretation of the seer and the displace ments of the subject. It is the regime of betrayal, universal betrayal, in which the true man never ceases to betray God just as God betrays man, with the wrath of God defining the new positivity. Before his death, Moses receives the words of the great song of betrayal. Even the prophet, unlike the seer-priest, is fundamentally a traitor and thus fulfills God's order bet ter than anyone who remained faithful could. God calls upon Jonah to go to Nineveh to entreat the inhabitants, who had repeatedly betrayed God, to mend their ways. But Jonah's first act is to take off in the opposite direc tion; he also betrays God, fleeing "far from the face of Adonai." 16 He takes a ship for Tarshish and sleeps, like a righteous man. The tempest sent by God causes him to be thrown into the sea, where he is swallowed by the great fish and vomited out at the boundary between land and water, the limit of separation or line of flight earlier occupied by the dove of the Ark (Jonah, precisely, is the word for dove). But Jonah, in fleeing from the face of God, did exactly what God had wanted: he took the evil of Nineveh upon himself; he did it even more effectively than God had wanted, he

God let him live, temporarily protected by the tree of Cain, but then made the tree die because Jonah had renewed the covenant by occupying the line of flight. 17 Jesus universalizes the system of betrayal: he betrays the God of the Jews, he betrays the Jews, he is betrayed by God ("Why hast thou forsaken me?" [Matthew 27:46; Mark 15:34—Trans.]), he is betrayed by Judas, the true man. He took evil upon himself, but the Jews who kill him also take it upon themselves. Jesus is asked for a sign of his divine descendance: he invokes the sign of Jonah [Luke 11:29—Trans.]. Cain, Jonah, and Jesus constitute three great linear proceedings along which signs rush and form relays. There are many others. Everywhere a double turning away on a line of flight. When a prophet declines the burden God entrusts to him (Moses, Jeremiah, Isaiah, etc.), it is not because the burden would have been too heavy, as with an imperial oracle or seer who refuses a dangerous mission. It is instead a case like Jonah's, who by hiding and fleeing and betraying anticipates the will of God more effectively than if he had obeyed. The prophet is always being forced by God, literally violated by him, much more than inspired by him. The prophet is not a priest. The prophet does not know how to talk, God puts the words in his mouth: word-ingestion, a new form of semiophagy. Unlike the seer, the prophet interprets nothing:  *his delusion is active rather than ideational or imaginative, *his relation to God is passional and authoritative rather than despotic and signifying; he anticipates and detects the powers *{puissances) *of the future rather than applying past and present powers *(pouvoirs). *Faciality traits no longer func tion to prevent the formation of a line of flight, or to form a body of signifiance controlling that line and sending only a faceless goat down it. Rather, it is faciality itself that organizes the line of flight, in the faceoff between two countenances that become gaunt and turn away in profile. Betrayal has become an idee fixe, the main obsession, replacing the deceit of the paranoiac and the hysteric. The "persecutor-persecuted" relation has no relevance whatsoever: its meaning is altogether different in the authoritarian passional regime than in the despotic paranoid regime. Something is still bothering us: the story of Oedipus. Oedipus is almost unique in the Greek world. The whole first part is imperial, despotic, para noid, interpretive, divinatory. But the whole second part is Oedipus's wan dering, his line of flight, the double turning away of his own face and that of God. Rather than very precise limits to be crossed in order, or which one does not have the right to cross *(hybris), *there is a concealed limit toward which Oedipus is swept. Rather than interpretive signifying irradiation, there is a subjective linear proceeding permitting Oedipus to keep a secret, but only as a residue capable of starting a new linear proceeding. Oedipus,

Holderlin and Heidegger see this as the birth of the  *double turning away, *the change of face, and also the birth of modern tragedy, for which they bizarrely credit the Greeks: the outcome is no longer murder or sudden death but survival under reprieve, unlimited postponement. 18 Nietzsche suggests that Oedipus, as opposed to Prometheus, was the Semitic myth of the Greeks, the glorification of Passion or passivity.' 9 Oedipus: Greek Cain. Let us return to psychoanalysis. It was not by chance that Freud pounced upon Oedipus. Psychoanalysis is a definite case of a mixed semiotic: a despotic regime of signifiance and interpretation, with irradiation of the face, but also an authoritarian regime of subjectification and prophetism, with a turning away of the face (the positioning of the psychoanalyst behind the patient suddenly assumes its full significance). Recent efforts to explain that a "signifier represents the subject for another signifier" are typically syncretic: a linear proceeding of subjectivity along with a circular development of the signifier and interpretation. Two absolutely different regimes of signs in a mix. But the worst, most underhanded of powers are founded on it. One more remark on the story of authoritarian passional betrayal, as opposed to despotic paranoid deception. Everything is infamy, but Borges botched his history of universal infamy. 20 He should have distinguished between the great realm of deceptions and the great realm of betrayals. And also between the various figures of betrayal. There is, in effect, a second fig ure of betrayal that springs up at certain places at certain times, but always as a function of a variable assemblage with new components. Christianity is a particularly important case of a mixed semiotic, with its signifying imperial combination together with its postsignifying Jewish subjectivity. It transforms both the ideal signifying system and the postsignifying passional system. It invents a new assemblage. Heresies are still a part of deception, just as orthodoxy is a part of signifiance. But there are heresies that are more than heresies and profess pure treason, for example, the Buggers; it is not by chance that the Bulgars played a special role. 21 Beware the Bulgars, as Monsieur Plume would say. The problem is one of territori alities in relation to deep movements of deterritorialization. England, another territoriality or another deterritorialization: Cromwell, every where a traitor, a straight line of passional subjectification opposed to the royal center of signifiance and the intermediary circles: the dictator against the despot. Richard III, the deformed, the twisted, whose ideal is to betray everything: he confronts Lady Anne in a face-off in which the two counte nances turn away, but each knows she or he is the other's, destined for the other. This is unlike Shakespeare's other historical dramas, in which kings

Richard III comes from elsewhere: his ven tures, including those with women, derive more from a war machine than from a State apparatus. He is the traitor, springing from the great nomads and their secrecy. He says so from the beginning, when he mentions a secret project infinitely surpassing the conquest of power. He wants to return the war machine both to the fragile State and pacified couples. The only one to guess is Lady Anne, fascinated, terrified, consenting. Elizabethan theater is full of these traitorous characters who aspire to be absolute traitors, in opposition to the deceptions of the man of the court or even of the State. How many betrayals accompanied the great discoveries of Christen dom, the discovery of new lands and continents! Lines of deterrito-rialization on which small groups betray everything, their companions, the king, the indigenous peoples, the neighboring explorer, in the mad hope of founding, with a woman of their family, a race that would finally be pure and represent a new beginning. Herzog's film,  *Aguirre, *is very Shakespearean. Aguirre asks, How can one be a traitor everywhere and in everything? I'm the only traitor here. No more deception, it's time for betrayal. What a grandiose dream! I will be the last traitor, the total traitor, and therefore the last man. Then there was the Reformation: the extraordinary figure of Luther, as traitor to all things and all people; his personal relation with the Devil resulting in betrayal, through good deeds as well as bad. These new figures of betrayal always return to the Old Testament: I am the wrath of God. But betrayal has become humanist, it does not fall between God and his own men; it relies on God, but falls between the men of God and the others, denounced as deceivers. In the end, there is only one man of God or of the wrath of God, a single betrayer against all deceivers. But every deceiver is mixed, and which does not take him- or herself to be the one? And what betrayer does not say to him- or herself at some point that he or she was nothing but a deceiver after all? (See the strange case of Maurice Sachs.) It is clear that the book, or what takes its place, has a different meaning in the signifying paranoid regime than in the postsignifying passional regime. In the first case, there is an emission of the despotic signifier, and its interpretation by scribes and priests, which fixes the signified and reimparts signifier; but there is also, from sign to sign, a movement from one territory to another, a circulation assuring a certain speed of deterritorialization (for example, the circulation of an epic, or the rivalry between several cities for the birth of a hero, or, once again, the role of scribe-priests in exchanges of territorialities and genealogies). 22 What takes the place of the book always has an external model, a referent, face,

On the con trary, in the passional regime the book seems to be internalized, and to internalize everything: it becomes the sacred written Book. It takes the place of the face and God, who hides his face and gives Moses the inscribed stone tablets. God manifests himself through trumpets and the Voice, but what is heard in sound is the nonface, just as what is seen in the book are words. *The book has become the body of passion, *just as the face was the body of the signifier. It is now the book, the most deterritorialized of things, that fixes territories and genealogies. The latter are what the book says, and the former the place at which the book is said. The function of interpretation has totally changed. Or it disappears entirely in favor of a pure and literal recitation forbidding the slightest change, addition, or commentary (the famous "stultify yourself of the Christians belongs to this passional line; the Koran goes the furthest in this direction). Or else interpretation survives but becomes internal to the book itself, which loses its circulatory function for outside elements: for example, the different types of coded interpretation are fixed according to axes internal to the book; interpretation is organized according to correspondences between two books, such as the Old and New Testaments, and may even induce a third book suffused by the same element of interiority. 23 Finally, interpre tation may reject all intermediaries or specialists and become direct, since the book is written both in itself and in the heart, once as a point of subjectification and again in the subject (the Reformation conception of the book). In any case, this is the point of departure for the delusional pas sion of the book as origin and finality of the world. The unique book, the total work, all possible combinations *inside *the book, the tree-book, the cosmos-book: all of these platitudes so dear to the avant-gardes, which cut the book off from its relations with the outside, are even worse than the chant of the signifier. Of course, they are entirely bound up with a mixed semiotic. But in truth they have a particularly pious origin. Wagner, Mallarme, and Joyce, Marx and Freud: still Bibles. If passional delusion is profoundly monomaniacal, monomania for its part found a fundamental element of its assemblage in monotheism and the Book. The strangest cult. This is how things are in the passional regime, or the regime of subjectification. There is no longer a center of signifiance connected to expanding circles or an expanding spiral, but a point of subjectification constituting the point of departure of the line. There is no longer a signifier-signified relation, but a subject of enunciation issuing from the point of subjectification and a subject of the statement in a determinable relation to the first subject. There is no longer sign-to-sign circularity, but a linear proceeding into which the sign is swept via subjects. We may con sider these three diverse realms.

0 128 □ 587 B.c.-A.D. 70: ON SEVERAL REGIMES OF SIGNS 1. *The Jews as opposed to the empires. *God withdraws his face, becom ing a point of subjectification for the drawing of a line of flight or deterritorialization; Moses is the subject of enunciation, constituted on the basis of the tablets of God that replace the face; the Jewish people consti tute the subject of the statement, for betrayal as well as for a new land, and enter an ever-renewed covenant or linear "proceeding" rather than a circu lar expansion. *2. So-called modern, or Christian, philosophy: *Descartes as opposed to ancient philosophy. There is a primacy of the idea of the infinite as an absolutely necessary point of subjectification. The Cogito, consciousness, the "I think" is the subject of enunciation that reflects its own use and conceives of itself following a line of deterritorialization represented by methodical doubt. The subject of the statement is the union of the soul and the body, or feeling, guaranteed in a complex way by the cogito, and per forms the necessary reterritorializations. The cogito is a proceeding that must always be recommenced, haunted by the possibility of betrayal, a deceitful God, and an evil Genius. When Descartes says, I can infer "I think therefore I am" but not "I walk therefore I am," he is initiating the distinction between the two subjects (what still-Cartesian contemporary linguists call a shifter, even though they find traces of the second subject in the first).* * 3. *Nineteenth-century psychiatry: *monomania distinguished from mania; subjective delusion separated from ideational delusions; "posses sion" replacing sorcery; a slow elaboration of passional delusion, as dis tinct from paranoia ... The schema of passional delusion according to Clerambault is as follows: the Postulate as the point of subjectification  *(He *loves me); pride as the tonality of the subject of enunciation (de lusional pursuit of the loved one); Spite, Rancor (a result of a reversion to the subject of the statement). Passional delusion is a veritable cogito. In the foregoing example of erotomania, as well as in jealousy and querulous delusion, Clerambault stresses that a sign must follow a segment or linear proceeding through to the end before it can begin another, whereas the signs in paranoid delusion form an endless, self-adjusting network devel oping in all directions. The cogito also follows a linear temporal proceed ing needing to be recommenced. The history of the Jews is punctuated by catastrophes after each of which there were just enough survivors to start a new proceeding. In the course of a proceeding, while there is linear movement the plural is often used, whereas there is a return to the Singu lar as soon as there is a pause or stoppage marking the end of one move ment before another begins. 24 Fundamental segmentarity: one proceeding must end (and its termination must be marked) before another begins, to enable another to begin.

0 587 B.c.-AD. 70: ON SEVERAL REGIMES OF SIGNS □ 129 The point of subj edification is the origin of the passional line of the postsignifying regime. The point of subjectification can be anything. It must only display the following characteristic traits of the subjective semiotic: the double turning away, betrayal, and existence under reprieve. For anorexics, food plays this role (anorexics do not confront death but save themselves by betraying food, which is equally a traitor since it is sus pected of containing larvae, worms, and microbes). A dress, an article of underwear, a shoe are points of subjectification for a fetishist. So is a faciality trait for someone in love, but the meaning of faciality has changed; it is no longer the body of the signifier but has become the point of departure for a deterritorialization that puts everything else to flight. A thing, an animal, will do the trick. There are cogitos on everything. "A pair of eyes set far apart, a head hewn of quartz, a haunch that seemed to live its own life.... Whenever the beauty of the female becomes irresisti ble, it is traceable to a single quality": 25 a point of subjectification in the departure of a passional line. Moreover, several points coexist in a given individual or group, which are always engaged in several distinct and not always compatible linear proceedings. The various forms of education or "normalization" imposed upon an individual consist in making him or her change points of subjectification, always moving toward a higher, nobler one in closer conformity with the supposed ideal. Then from the point of subjectification issues a subject of enunciation, as a function of a mental reality determined by that point. Then from the subject of enunciation issues a subject of the statement, in other words, a subject bound to statements in conformity with a dominant reality (of which the mental reality just mentioned is a part, even when it seems to oppose it). What is important, what makes the postsignifying passional line a line of subjecti fication or subjection, is the constitution, the doubling of the two sub jects, and the recoiling of one into the other, of the subject of enunciation into the subject of the statement (the linguists acknowledge this when they speak of the "imprint of the process of enunciation in the state ment"). Signifiance brought about uniformity in the substance of enunci ation; now subjectivity effects an individuation, collective or particular. Substance has become subject, as they say. *The subject of enunciation  recoils into the subject of the statement, to the point that the subject of the  statement resupplies subject of enunciation for another proceeding. *The subject of the statement has become the "respondent" or guarantor of the subject of enunciation, through a kind of reductive echolalia, in a biunivocal relation. This relation, this recoiling, is also that of mental reality into the dominant reality. There is always an appeal to a dominant reality that functions from within (already in the Old Testament, and dur ing the Reformation, with trade and capitalism). There is no longer even a

0 130 □ 587 B.c.-A.D. 70: ON SEVERAL REGIMES OF SIGNS need for a transcendent center of power; power is instead immanent and melds with the "real," operating through normalization. A strange inven tion: as if in one form the doubled subject were the *causeof *the statements of which, in its other form, it itself is a part. This is the paradox of the legislator-subject replacing the signifying despot: the more you obey the statements of the dominant reality, the more in command you are as sub ject of enunciation in mental reality, for in the end you are only obeying yourself! You are the one in command, in your capacity as a rational being. A new form of slavery is invented, namely, being slave to oneself, or to pure "reason," the Cogito. Is there anything more passional than pure reason? Is there a colder, more extreme, more self-interested passion than the Cogito? Althusser clearly brings out this constitution of social individuals as subjects: he calls it interpellation ("Hey you, over there!") and calls the point of subjectification the Absolute Subject; he analyzes the "specular doubling" of subjects and for purposes of demonstration uses the example of God, Moses, and the Jewish people. 26 Linguists like Benveniste adopt a curious linguistic personology that is very close to the Cogito: the *You, * which can doubtless designate the person one is addressing, but more importantly, a point of subjectification on the basis of which each of us is constituted as a subject. The /as subject of enunciation, designating the person that utters and reflects its own use in the statement ("the empty nonreferential sign"); this is the I appearing in propositions of the type "I believe, I assume, I think..." Finally, the I as subject of the statement, indicating a state for which a *She *or *He *could always be substituted ("I suf fer, I walk, I breathe, I feel.. ."). 27 This is not, however, a question of a lin guistic operation, for a subject is never the condition of possibility of language or the cause of the statement: there is no subject, only collective assemblages of enunciation. Subjectification is simply one such assem blage and designates a formalization of expression or a regime of signs rather than a condition internal to language. Neither is it a question of a movement characteristic of ideology, as Althusser says: subjectification as a regime of signs or a form of expression is tied to an assemblage, in other words, an organization of power that is already fully functioning in the economy, rather than superposing itself upon contents or relations between contents determined as real in the last instance. Capital is a point of subjectification par excellence. The psychoanalytic cogito: the psychoanalyst presents him- or herself as an ideal point of subjectification that brings the patient to abandon old, so-called neurotic, points. The patient is partially a subject of enunciation in all he or she says to the psychoanalyst, and under the artificial mental conditions of the session: the patient is therefore called the "analysand."

0 587 B.C.-A.D. 70: ON SEVERAL REGIMES OF SIGNS D 131 But in everything else the patient says or does, he or she is a subject of the statement, eternally psychoanalyzed, going from one linear proceeding to another, perhaps even changing analysts, growing increasingly submissive to the normalization of a dominant reality. In this sense, psychoanalysis, with its mixed semiotic, fully participates in a line of subjectification. The psychoanalyst does not even have to speak anymore, the analysand assumes the burden of interpretation; as for the psychoanalyzed patient, the more he or she thinks about "his" or "her" next session, or the preced ing one, in segments, the better a subject he or she is. Just as the paranoid regime had two axes—one sign referring to another (making the sign a signifier), and the signifier referring to the signified—so too the passional regime, the line of subjectification, has two axes, one syntagmatic and the other paradigmatic: as we have just seen, the first axis is consciousness. Consciousness as passion is precisely that doubling of subjects, of the subject of enunciation and the subject of the statement, and the recoiling of one into the other. But the second form of subjectification is love as passion, love-passion, another type of double, of doubling and recoiling. Here again, a variable point of subjectification serves to distrib ute two subjects that as much conceal their faces as reveal them to each other, that wed a line of flight, a line of deterritorialization forever drawing them together and driving them apart. But everything changes: there is a celibate side to this doubled consciousness, and there is a passional love couple that no longer has any use for consciousness or reason. Yet it is the same regime, even in betrayal and even if the betraying is done by a third party. Adam and Eve, and Cain's wife (about whom the Bible should have said more). Richard III, the traitor, is in the end given consciousness in a dream, but only the strange face-off with Lady Anne, a meeting of two countenances that conceal themselves knowing that they have promised themselves to each other following the same line that will nonetheless sepa rate them. The most loyal and tender, or intense, love assigns subject of enunciation and a subject of the statement that constantly switch places, wrapped in the sweetness of being a naked statement in the other's mouth, and of the other's being a naked enunciation in my own mouth. But there is always a traitor in the making. What love is not betrayed? What cogito lacks its evil genius, the traitor it will never be rid of? "Tristan . . . Isolde . . . Isolde.. . Tristan": the cry of the two subjects climbs the scale of intensities until it reaches the summit of a suffocating consciousness, whereas the ship follows the line of the waters, the line of death and the unconscious, betrayal, a continuous melody line. Passional love is a cogito built for two, just as the cogito is a passion for the self alone. There is a potential couple in the cogito, just as there is a doubling of a single virtual subject in love-passion. Klossowski has created the strangest figures on the basis of this

0 132 □ 587 B.c.-A.D. 70: ON SEVERAL REGIMES OF SIGNS complementarity between an over intense thought and an over feverish couple. The line of subjectification is thus entirely occupied by the Double, but it has two figures since there are two kinds of doubles: the syntagmatic figure of consciousness, or the consciousness-related double, relating to form (Self = Self *[Moi = Moi]); *and the paradigmatic figure of the couple, or the passional double, relating to substance (Man = Woman; here, the double is immediately the difference between the sexes). We can follow the becoming of these doubles in mixed semiotics, which are interminglings as well as degradations. On the one hand, the passional love double, the couple in love-passion, falls into a conjugal relation or even a "domestic squabble" situation: Which is the subject of enunciation? Which is the subject of the statement? The battle of the sexes: *You 're steal-  ing my thoughts. *The domestic squabble has always been a cogito for two, a war cogito. Strindberg took this fall of love-passion into despotic conju gality and hysterico-paranoid squabbling to its extreme ("she" says she found it all by herself when in fact she owes it all to me, echo, thought theft, O Strindberg!). 28 On the other hand, the consciousness-related double of pure thought, the couple of the legislating subject, falls into a bureaucratic relation and a new form of persecution in which one double takes over the role of subject of enunciation while the other is reduced to a subject of the statement; the cogito itself becomes an "office squabble," a bureaucratic love delusion. A new form of bureaucracy replaces or conjugates with the old imperial bureaucracy, the bureaucrat says / *think *(Kafka goes the fur thest in this direction, as in the example of Sortini and Sordini in *The Cas-  tle, *or the many subjectifications of Klamm). 29 Conjugality is the development of the couple, and bureaucracy the development of the cogito. But one is contained in the other: amorous bureaucracy, bureau cratic couple. Too much has been written on the double, haphazardly, metaphysically, finding it everywhere, in any old mirror, without noticing the specific regime it possesses both in a mixed semiotic where it intro duces new phases, and in the pure semiotic of subjectification where it inscribes itself on a line of flight and introduces very particular figures. Once again: the two figures of thought-consciousness and love-passion in the postsignifying regime; the two moments of bureaucratic consciousness and conjugal relation in the mixed fall or combination. But even in a mixed state, the original line is easily discovered by semiotic analysis. There is a redundancy of consciousness and love that is not the same as the signifying redundancy of the other regime. In the signifying regime, redundancy is a phenomenon of objective *frequency *involving signs or ele ments of signs (the phonemes, letters, and groups of letters in a language): there is both a maximum frequency of the signifier in relation to each sign, and a comparative frequency of one sign in relation to another. In any case,

0 587 B.c.-A.D. 70: ON SEVERAL REGIMES OF SIGNS D 133 it could be said that this regime develops a kind of "wall" on which signs are inscribed, in relation to one another and in relation to the signifier. In the postsignifying regime, on the other hand, the redundancy is one of *subjec-  tive resonance *involving above all shifters, personal pronouns and proper names. Here again, we may distinguish between the maximum resonance of self-consciousness (Self = Self *[Moi *= *Moi]) *and a comparative reso nance of names (Tristan ... Isolde ...). This time, however, there is no longer a wall upon which the frequency is tallied but instead a black hole attracting consciousness and passion and in which they resonate. Tristan calls Isolde, Isolde calls Tristan, both drawn toward the black hole of a self-consciousness, carried by the tide toward death. When the linguists distinguish between two forms of redundancy, frequency and resonance, they often ascribe the latter a merely derivative status. 30 In fact, it is a question of two semiotics that mix but retain their own distinct principles (similarly, one could define other forms of redundancy, such as rhythmic, gestural, or numerical, relating to the other regimes of signs). The most essential distinction between the signifying regime and the subjective regime and their respective redundancies is the *movement of  deterritorialization *they effectuate. Since the signifying sign refers only to other signs, and the set of all signs to the signifier itself, the corresponding semiotic enjoys a high level of deterritorialization; but it is a deterritorialization that is still *relative, *expressed as frequency. In this system, the line of flight remains negative, it is assigned a negative sign. As we have seen, the subjective regime proceeds entirely differently: precisely because the sign breaks its relation of signifiance with other signs and sets off racing down a positive line of flight, it attains an  *absolute *deterritorialization expressed in the black hole of consciousness and passion. The absolute deterritorialization of the cogito. That is why subjective redundancy seems both to graft itself onto signifying redundancy and to derive from it, as second-degree redundancy. Things are even more complicated than we have let on. Subjectification assigns the line of flight a positive sign, it carries deterritorialization to the absolute, intensity to the highest degree, redundancy to a reflexive form, etc. But it has its own way of repudiating the positivity it frees, or of relativizing the absoluteness it attains, without, however, falling back to the preceding regime. In this redundancy of resonance, the absolute of con sciousness is the absolute of impotence and the intensity of passion, the heat of the void. This is because subjectification essentially constitutes finite linear proceedings, one of which ends before the next begins: thus the cogito is always recommenced, a passion or grievance is always recapitu lated. Every consciousness pursues its own death, every love-passion its own end, attracted by a black hole, and all the black holes resonate together.

0 134 □ 587 B.c.-AD. 70. ON SEVERAL REGIMES OF SIGNS Thus subjectification imposes on the line of flight a segmentarity that is forever repudiating that line, and upon absolute deterritorialization a point of abolition that is forever blocking that deterritorialization or diverting it. The reason for this is simple: forms of expression and regimes of signs are still *strata *(even considered in themselves, after abstracting forms of content); subjectification is no less a stratum than signifiance. The principal strata binding human beings are the organism, signifiance and interpretation, and subjectification and subjection. These strata to gether are what separates us from the plane of consistency and the abstract machine, where there is no longer any regime of signs, where the line of flight effectuates its own potential positivity and deterritorialization its absolute power. The problem, from this standpoint, is to tip the most favor able assemblage from its side facing the strata to its side facing the plane of consistency or the body without organs. Subjectification carries desire to such a point of excess and unloosening that it must either annihilate itself in a black hole or change planes. Destratify, open up to a new function, a  *diagrammatic *function. Let consciousness cease to be its own double, and passion the double of one person for another. Make consciousness an experimentation in life, and passion a field of continuous intensities, an emission of particles-signs. Make the body without organs of conscious ness and love. Use love and consciousness to abolish subjectification: "To become the great lover, the magnetizer and catalyzer ... one has to first experience the profound wisdom of being an utter fool." 31 Use the / *think * for a becoming-animal, and love for a becoming-woman of man. Desub-jectify consciousness and passion. Are there not diagrammatic redundancies distinct from both signifying redundancies and subjective redundancies? Redundancies that would no longer be knots of arborescence but resumptions and upsurges in a rhizome? Stammer language, be a foreigner in one's own tongue: do domi not passi do not dominate do not dominate your passive passions not do devouring not not dominate your rats your rations your rats rations not not. . . 32 It seems necessary to distinguish between three types of deterrito-  rialization: the first type is relative, proper to the strata, and culminates in  signifiance; the second is absolute, but still negative and stratic, and  appears in subjectification *{Ratio et Passio); *finally, there is the possibility  of a positive absolute deterritorialization on the plane of consistency or the  body without organs.

587 B.c.-AD. 70: ON SEVERAL REGIMES OF SIGNS □ 135 We have not, of course, managed to eliminate forms of content (for example, the role of the Temple, or the position of a dominant Reality,  etc.). What we have done is to isolate, under artificial conditions, a certain  number of semiotics displaying very diverse characteristics. The  *presigni-fying semiotic, *in which the "overcoding" marking the privileged  status of language operates diffusely: enunciation is collective, statements  themselves are polyvocal, and substances of expression are multiple;  relative deterritorialization is determined by the confrontation between  the territorialities and segmentary lineages that ward off the State  apparatus. The *signifying semiotic: *overcoding is fully effectuated by the  signifier, and by the State apparatus that emits it; there is uniformity of  enunciation, unification of the substance of expression, and control over  statements in a regime of circularity; relative deterritorialization is taken as  far as it can go by a redundant and perpetual referral from sign to sign.  The *countersig-nifying semiotic: *here, overcoding is assured by the  Number as form of expression or enunciation, and by the War Machine  upon which it depends; deterritorialization follows a line of active  destruction or abolition. The *postsignifying semiotic, *in which overcoding  is assured by the redundancy of consciousness; a subjectification of  enunciation occurs on a passional line that makes the organization of  power *(pouvoir) *immanent and raises deterritorialization to the absolute,  although in a way that is still negative. (1) The Center or the Signifier; the faciality of the god or despot. (2) The Temple or Pal-  ace, with priests and bureaucrats. (3) The organization in circles and the sign referring  to other signs on the same circle or on different circles. (4) The interpretive develop-  ment of signifier into signified, which then reimparts signifier. (5) The expiatory ani-  mal; the blocking of the line of flight. (6) The scapegoat, or the negative sign of the line  of flight.

0 136 □ 587 B.c.-A.D. 70: ON SEVERAL REGIMES OF SIGNS Yet we must consider two aspects: on the one hand, these semiotics are still concrete even after forms of content have been abstracted, but only to the extent that they are mixed, that they constitute mixed combinations. Every semiotic is mixed and only functions as such; each one necessarily captures fragments of one or more other semiotics (surplus value of code). Even from this perspective, the signifying semiotic has no privileged status to apply toward the formation of a general semiology: in particular, the way in which it combines with the passional semiotic of subjectification ("the signifier for the subject") implies nothing that would privilege it over other combinations, for example, the combination of the passional semiotic and the countersignifying semiotic, or of the countersignifying semiotic and the signifying semiotic itself (when the Nomads turn imperial), etc. There is no general semiology. For example, without privileging one regime over another, it is possible to construct schemas of the signifying and postsignifying semiotics that clearly illustrate the possibilities for concrete mixture. The second aspect, complementary but very different, consists in the possibility of transforming one abstract or pure semiotic into another, by virtue of the translatability ensuing from overcoding as the special charac teristic of language. This time, it is no longer a question of concrete mixed semiotics but of transformations of one abstract semiotic into another (even though that transformation is not itself abstract, in other words, effectively takes place without being performed by a "translator" in the role of pure knower). All transformations taking a given semiotic into the presignifying regime may be called *analogical transformations; *those that take it into the signifying regime are *symbolic; *into the countersignifying regime, *polemical or strategic; *into the postsignifying regime, *conscious-  ness-related or mimetic; *finally, transformations that blow apart semiotics systems or regimes of signs on the plane of consistency of a positive abso lute deterritorialization are called *diagrammatic. *A transformation is not the same thing as a statement in a pure semiotic; nor even an ambiguous statement requiring a whole pragmatic analysis to determine the semiotic it belongs to; nor a statement belonging to a mixed semiotic (although the transformation may have that effect). A transformational statement marks the way in which a semiotic translates for its own purposes a statement originating elsewhere, and in so doing diverts it, leaving untransformable residues and actively resisting the inverse transformation. Furthermore, transformations are not limited to the ones we just listed. It is always through transformation that a new semiotic is created in its own right. Translations can be creative. New pure regimes of signs are formed through transformation and translation. Again, there is no general semiology but rather a transsemiotic.

In analogical transformations, we often see sleep, drugs, and amorous rapture form expressions that translate into presignifying regimes the sub jective or signifying regimes one wishes to impose upon the expressions, but which they resist by themselves imposing upon these regimes an unex pected segmentarity and polyvocality. Christianity underwent strange cre ative translations in its transmission to "barbarian" or even "savage" peoples. The introduction of monetary signs into certain commercial cir cuits in Africa caused those signs to undergo an analogical transformation that was very difficult to control (except when the circuits underwent a destructive transformation instead). 33 The songs of black Americans, including, especially, the words, would be a better example, since they show how the slaves "translated" the English signifier and made presig nifying or even countersignifying use of the language, blending it with their own African languages just as they blended old African work songs with their new forced labor; these songs also show how, with Christianization and the abolition of slavery, the slaves underwent a proceeding of "subjectification" or even "individuation" that transformed their music, while the music simultaneously transformed the proceeding by analogy; and also how unique problems of "faciality" were posed when whites in "blackface" appropriated the words and songs and blacks responded by darkening their faces another hue, taking back their dances and songs, even transforming or translating those of the whites. 34 Of course, the crudest and most visible transformations were in the other direction: the symbolic translations occurring when the signifier takes power. The preceding exam ples concerning monetary signs and rhythmic regimes can be repeated in the opposite direction.

("In Africa the dance is impersonal, sacred and obscene. When the phallus becomes erect and is handled like a banana it is not a 'personal hard-on' we see but a tribal erection. ... The hoochie-koochie dancer of the big city dances alone—a fact of staggering significance. The law forbids response, forbids participation. Nothing is left of the primitive rite but the 'suggestive' movements of the body. What they suggest varies with *the individual * *observer.")* *35* It is not simply linguistic, lexical, or even syntactic transformations that determine the importance of a true semiotic translation but the opposite. Crazy talk is not enough. In each case we must judge whether what we see is an adaptation of an old semiotic, a new variety of a particular mixed semiotic, or the process of creation of an as yet unknown regime. For exam ple, it is relatively easy to stop saying "I," but that does not mean that you have gotten away from the regime of subjectification; conversely, you can keep on saying "I," just for kicks, and already be in another regime in which personal pronouns function only as fictions. Signifiance and interpretation are so thick-skinned, they form such a sticky mixture with sub jectification, that it is easy to believe that you are outside them when you are in fact still secreting them. People sometimes denounce interpretation yet show so signifying a face that they simultaneously impose interpreta tion upon the subject, which continues to nourish itself on it in order to sur vive. Who can really believe that psychoanalysis is capable of changing a semiotic amassing every deception? The only change there has been is a role switch. Instead of a patient who signifies and a psychoanalyst who interprets, we now have a signifying analyst and it is the patient who does all the interpreting. In the antipsychiatric experiment of Kingsley Hall, Mary Barnes, a former nurse turned "schizophrenic," embraces the new semiotic of the Voyage, only to arrogate to herself a veritable power in the community and reintroduce as a collective delusion the worst kind of psy choanalytic regime of interpretation ("She *interpreted *everything that was done for her, or for anyone else for that matter. . ."). 36 A highly stratified semiotic is difficult to get away from. Even a presignifying, or counter-signifying, semiotic, even an asignifying diagram, harbors knots of coincidence just waiting to form virtual centers of signifiance and points of subjectification. Of course, an operation of translation is not easy when it is a question of destroying a dominant atmospheric semiotic. One of the things of profound interest in Castaneda's books, under the influence of drugs, or other things, and of a change of atmosphere, is precisely that they show how the Indian manages to combat the mechanisms of interpretation and instill in the disciple a presignifying semiotic, or even an asignifying

Find your own places, territorialities, deterritorializations, regime, lines of flight! Semiotize yourself instead of rooting around in your prefab childhood and Western semiology. "Don Juan stated that in order to arrive at 'seeing' one first had to 'stop the world.' 'Stopping the world' was indeed an appropriate rendition of certain states of awareness in which the reality of everyday life is altered because the flow of interpretation, which ordinarily runs uninterruptedly, has been stopped by a set of circum stances alien to the flow." 37 In short, a true semiotic transformation appeals to all kinds of variables, not only external ones, but also variables implicit to language, internal to statements. Pragmatics, then, already displays two components. The first could be called *generative *since it shows how the various abstract regimes form con crete mixed semiotics, with what variants, how they combine, and which one is predominant. The second is the *transformational *component, which shows how these regimes of signs are translated into each other, especially when there is a creation of a new regime. Generative pragmatics makes tracings of mixed semiotics; transformational pragmatics makes maps of transformations. Although a mixed semiotic does not necessarily imply effective creativity, and may content itself with combinatory possibilities without veritable transformation, it is still the transformational compo nent that accounts for the originality of a regime as well as for the novelty of the mixes it enters at a given moment in a given domain. This second com ponent is therefore the more profound, and it is the only means of measur ing the elements of the first component. 38 For example, we may ask when statements of the Bolshevik type first appeared, and how Leninism, at the time of the break with the social democrats, effected a veritable transfor mation that created an original semiotic, even if its fall into the mixed semiotic of Stalinist organization was inevitable. In an exemplary study, Jean-Pierre Faye did a detailed analysis of the transformations that pro duced Nazism, viewed as a system of new statements in a given social field. At what moment is a regime of signs established, and in what domain? Throughout an entire people? In a fraction of that people? In a more or less localizable margin inside a psychiatric hospital? (For as we have seen we can find a semiotic of subjectification in the ancient history of the Jews, but also in psychiatric diagnosis in the nineteenth century, with, of course, profound variations and even veritable transformations in the correspond ing semiotic.) All of these questions fall within the purview of pragmatics. There is no question that the most profound transformations and transla tions of our time are not occurring in Europe. Pragmatics should reject the idea of an invariant immune from transformation, even if it is the in variant of a dominant "grammaticality." For language is a political affair

What is a semiotic, in other words, a regime of signs or a formalization of expression? They are simultaneously more and less than language. Language as a whole is defined by "superlinearity," its condition of possi bility; individual languages are defined by constants, elements, and rela tions of a phonological, syntactical, and semantic nature. Doubtless, every regime of signs effectuates the condition of possibility of language and utilizes language elements, but that is all. No regime can be identical to that condition of possibility, and no regime has the property of con stants. As Foucault clearly shows, regimes of signs are only *functions of  existence *of language that sometimes span a number of languages and are sometimes distributed within a single language; they coincide neither with a structure nor with units of a given order, but rather intersect them and cause them to appear in space and time. This is the sense in which regimes of signs are assemblages of enunciation, which cannot be ade quately accounted for by any linguistic category: *what makes a proposi-  tion or even a single word a "statement" *pertains to implicit presupposi tions that cannot be made explicit, that mobilize pragmatic variables proper to enunciation (incorporeal transformations). This precludes explaining an assemblage in terms of the signifier or the subject, because both pertain to variables of enunciation within the assemblage. It is signifiance and subjectification that presuppose the assemblage, not the reverse. The names we gave to the regimes of signs ("presignifying," "sig nifying," "countersignifying," "postsignifying") would remain evolution ist if heterogeneous functions or varieties of assemblages did not effectively correspond to them (segmentarization, signifiance and inter pretation, numeration, subjectification). Regimes of signs are thus defined by variables that are internal to enunciation but remain external to the constants of language and irreducible to linguistic categories. But at this point, everything turns around, and the reasons why a regime of signs is less than language also become the reasons why it is more than language. Only one side of the assemblage has to do with enunciation or formalizes expression; on its other side, inseparable from the first, it for malizes contents, it is a machinic assemblage or an assemblage of bodies. Now contents are not "signifieds" dependent upon a signifier in any way, nor are they "objects" in any kind of relation of causality with the subject. They have their own formalization and have no relation of symbolic corre spondence or linear causality with the form of expression: the two forms are in reciprocal presupposition, and they can be abstracted from each other only in a very relative way because they are two sides of a single assemblage. We must therefore arrive at something in the assemblage itself

587 B.c.-AD. 70: ON SEVERAL REGIMES OF SIGNS □ 141 that is still more profound than these sides and can account for both of the forms in presupposition, forms of expression or regimes of signs (semiotic systems) and forms of content or regimes of bodies (physical systems). This is what we call the *abstract machine, *which constitutes and conjugates all of the assemblage's cutting edges of deterritorialization. 39 We must say that the abstract machine is necessarily "much more" than language. When lin guists (following Chomsky) rise to the idea of a purely language-based abstract machine, our immediate objection is that their machine, far from being too abstract, is not abstract enough because it is limited to the form of expression and to alleged uni versals that presuppose language. Abstracting content is an operation that appears all the more relative and inadequate when seen from the viewpoint of abstraction itself. A true abstract machine has no way of making a distinction within itself between a plane of expres sion and a plane of content because it draws a single plane of consistency, which in turn formalizes contents and expressions according to strata and reterritorializations. The abstract machine in itself is destratified, deter-ritorialized; it has no form of its own (much less substance) and makes no distinction within itself between content and expression, even though outside itself it presides over that distinction and distributes it in strata, domains, and territories. An abstract machine in itself is not physical or corporeal, any more than it is semiotic; it is *diagrammatic *(it knows nothing of the distinction between the artificial and the natural either). It operates by *matter, *not by substance; by *function, *not by form. Substances and forms are of expression "or" of content. But functions are not yet "semiotically" formed, and matters are not yet "physically" formed. The abstract machine is pure Matter-Function—a diagram independent of the forms and substances, expressions and contents it will distribute. We define the abstract machine as the aspect or moment at which noth ing but functions and matters remain. A diagram has neither substance nor form, neither content nor expression. 40 Substance is a formed matter, and matter is a substance that is unformed either physically or semiotically. Whereas expression and content have distinct forms, are really distinct from each other, function has only "traits," of content and of expression, between which it establishes a connection: it is no longer even possible to tell whether it is a particle or a sign. A matter-content having only degrees of intensity, resistance, conductivity, heating, stretching, speed, or tardi ness; and a function-expression having only "tensors," as in a system of mathematical, or musical, writing. Writing now functions on the same level as the real, and the real materially writes. The diagram retains the most deterritorialized content and the most deterritorialized expression, in order to conjugate them. Maximum deterritorialization sometimes starts from a trait of content and sometimes from a trait of expression; that

142 D 587 B.c-AD. 70: ON SEVERAL REGIMES OF SIGNS trait is said to be "deterritorializing" in relation to the other precisely because it diagrams it, carries it off, raises it to its own power. The most deterritorialized element causes the other element to cross a threshold ena bling a conjunction of their respective deterritorializations, a shared accel eration. This is the abstract machine's absolute, positive deterritoria-lization. That is why *diagrams *must be distinguished from  *indexes, *which are territorial signs, but also from *icons, *which pertain to reterrito-rialization, and from *symbols, *which pertain to relative or negative deterri-torialization. 41 Defined diagrammatically in this way, an abstract machine is neither an infrastructure that is determining in the last instance nor a transcendental Idea that is determining in the supreme instance. Rather, it plays a piloting role. The diagrammatic or abstract machine does not function to represent, even something real, but rather constructs a real that is yet to come, a new type of reality. Thus when it constitutes points of creation or potentiality it does not stand outside history but is instead always "prior to" history. Everything escapes, everything creates—never alone, but through an abstract machine that produces continuums of intensity, effects conjunctions of deterritorialization, and extracts expressions and contents. This Real-Abstract is totally different from the fictitious abstraction of a supposedly pure machine of expression. It is an Absolute, but one that is neither undifferentiated nor transcendent. Abstract machines thus have proper names (as well as dates), which of course designate not persons or subjects but matters and functions. The name of a musician or scientist is used in the same way as a painter's name designates a color, nuance, tone, or intensity: it is always a question of a conjunction of Matter and Function. The double deterritorialization of the voice and the instrument is marked by a Wagner abstract machine, a Webern abstract machine, etc. In physics and mathematics, we may speak of a Riemann abstract machine, and in algebra of a Galois abstract machine (defined precisely by an arbitrary line, called the adjunctive line, which conjugates with a body taken as a starting point), etc. There is a diagram whenever a singular abstract machine functions directly in a matter. Strictly speaking, therefore, there are no regimes of signs on the dia grammatic level, or on the plane of consistency, because form of expression is no longer really distinct from form of content. The diagram knows only traits and cutting edges that are still elements of content insofar as they are material and of expression insofar as they are functional, but which draw one another along, form relays, and meld in a shared deterritorialization: particles-signs. There is nothing surprising in this, for the real distinction between form of expression and form of content appears only with the strata, and is different on each one. It is on the strata that the double articu lation appears that formalizes traits of expression and traits of content,

Expression then constitutes indexes, icons, or symbols that enter regimes or semiotic systems. Content then constitutes bodies, things, or objects that enter physical systems, organisms, and organizations. The deeper movement for conjugating matter and function—absolute deterri-torialization, identical to the earth itself—appears only in the form of respective territorialities, negative or relative deterritorializations, and complementary reterritorializations. All of this culminates in a language stratum that installs an abstract machine on the level of expression and takes the abstraction of content even further, tending to strip it of any form of its own (the imperialism of language, the pretensions to a general semiology). In short, the strata substantialize diagrammatic matters and separate a formed plane of content from a formed plane of expression. They hold expressions and contents, separately substantialized and forma lized, in the pincers of a double articulation assuring their independence and real distinction and enthroning a dualism that endlessly reproduces and redivides. They shatter the continuums of intensity, introducing breaks between different strata and within each stratum. They prevent conjunctions of flight from forming and crush the cutting edges of deterri-torialization, either by effecting reterritorializations that make these movements merely relative, or by assigning certain of the lines an entirely negative value, or again by segmenting them, blocking them, plugging them, or plunging them into a kind of black hole. Above all, diagrammaticism should not be confused with an operation of the axiomatic type. Far from drawing creative lines of flight and conju gating traits of positive deterritorialization, axiomatics blocks all lines, subordinates them to a punctual system, and halts the geometric and alge braic writing systems that had begun to run off in all directions. This hap pened in relation to the question of indeterminism in physics: a "reorder ing" was undertaken to reconcile it with physical determinism. Mathemat ical writing systems were axiomatized, in other words, restratified, resemiotized, and material flows were rephysicalized. It is as much a politi cal as a scientific affair: science must not go crazy. Hilbert and de Broglie were as much politicians as scientists: they reestablished order. An axiomatization, a semiotization, a physicalization, is not a diagram but in fact the opposite of a diagram. The program of a stratum, against the dia gram of the plane of consistency. This does not, however, preclude the diagram's heading back down the road to escape and scattering new, singu lar abstract machines (the mathematical creation of improbable functions was carried out in opposition to axiomatization, and the material inven tion of unfindable particles in opposition to physicalization).

0 144 D 587 B . C . A . D . 70: ON SEVERAL REGIMES OF SIGNS such is like everything else; madness is as intrinsic to it as reorderings. The same scientists may participate in both aspects, having their own madness, police, signifiances, or subjectifications, as well as their own abstract machines, all in their capacity as scientists. The phrase "the politics of sci ence" is a good designation for these currents, which are internal to science and not simply circumstances and State factors that act upon it from the outside, leading it to make as atomic bomb here and embark upon a space program there. These political influences or determinations would not exist if science itself did not have its own poles, oscillations, strata, and destratifications, its own lines of flight and reorderings, in short, the more or less potential events of its own politics, its own particular "polemics," its own internal war machine (of which thwarted, persecuted, or hindered sci entists are historically a part). It is not enough to say that axiomatics does not take invention and creation into account: it possesses a deliberate will to halt or stabilize the diagram, to take its place by lodging itself on a level of coagulated abstraction too large for the concrete but too small for the real. We will see in what sense this is the "capitalist" level. We cannot, however, content ourselves with a dualism between the plane of consistency and its diagrams and abstract machines on the one hand, and the strata and their programs and concrete assemblages on the other. Abstract machines do not exist only on the plane of consistency, upon which they develop diagrams; they are already present enveloped or "encasted" in the strata in general, or even erected on particular strata upon which they simultaneously organize a form of expression and a form of content. What is illusory in the second case is the idea of an exclusively expressive or language-based abstract machine, not the idea of an abstract machine internal to the stratum and accounting for the relativity of those two distinct forms. Thus there are two complementary movements, one by which abstract machines work the strata and are constantly setting things loose, another by which they are effectively stratified, effectively captured by the strata. *On the one hand, *strata could never organize themselves if they did not harness diagrammatic matters or functions and formalize them from the standpoint of both expression and content; every regime of signs, and even signifiance and subjectification, is still a diagrammatic effect (although relativized and negativized). *One the other hand, *abstract machines would never be present, even on the strata, if they did not have the power or potentiality to extract and accelerate destratified particles-signs (the passage to the absolute). Consistency is neither totalizing nor structuring; rather, it is deterritorializing (a biological stratum, for example, evolves not according to statistical phenomena but rather according to cutting edges of deterritorialization). The security, tranquillity, and ho-meostatic equilibrium of the strata are thus never completely guaranteed:

0 587 B.C.-A.D. 70: ON SEVERAL REGIMES OF SIGNS □ 145 to regain a plane of consistency that inserts itself into the most diverse sys tems of stratification and jumps from one to the other, it suffices to prolong the lines of flight working the strata, to connect the dots, to conjugate the processes of deterritorialization. We have seen that signifiance and inter pretation, consciousness and passion, can prolong themselves following these lines, and at the same time open out onto a properly diagrammatic experience. All of these states or modes of the abstract machine coexist in what we call the *machinic assemblage. *The assemblage has two poles or vectors: one vector is oriented toward the strata, upon which it distributes territorialities, relative deterritorializations, and reterritorializations; the other is oriented toward the plane of consistency or destratification, upon which it conjugates processes of deterritorialization, carrying them to the absolute of the earth. It is along its stratic vector that the assemblage differ entiates a form of expression (from the standpoint of which it appears as a collective assemblage of enunciation) from a form of content (from the standpoint of which it appears as a machinic assemblage of bodies); it fits one form to the other, one manifestation to the other, placing them in recip rocal presupposition. But along its diagrammatic or destratified vector, it no longer has two sides; all it retains are traits of expression and content from which it extracts degrees of deterritorialization that add together and cutting edges that conjugate. A regime of signs has more than just two components. It has, in fact, four of them, which form the object of Pragmatics. The first was the *generative * component, which shows how a form of expression located on the language stratum always appeals to several combined regimes, in other words, how every regime of signs or semiotic is concretely mixed. On the level of this component, one *can *abstract forms of content, most successfully if empha sis is placed on the mixture of regimes in the form of expression: one should not, however, conclude from this the predominance of a regime constitut ing a general semiology and unifying forms. The second, *transformational, * component, shows how one abstract regime can be translated, transformed into another, and especially how it can be created from other regimes. This second component is obviously more profound, because all mixed regimes presuppose these transformations from one regime to another, past, pres ent, or potential (as a function of the creation of new regimes). Once again, one abstracts, or can abstract, content, since the analysis is limited to meta morphoses internal to the form of expression, even though the form of expression is not adequate to account for them. The third component is  *diagrammatic: *it consists in taking regimes of signs or forms of expression and extracting from them particles-signs that are no longer formalized but instead constitute unformed traits capable of combining with one another. This is the height of abstraction, but also the moment at which abstraction

146 □ 587 B.c.-A.D. 70: ON SEVERAL REGIMES OF SIGNS becomes real; everything operates through abstract-real machines (which have names and dates). One can abstract forms of content, but one must simultaneously abstract forms of expression; for what is retained of each are only unformed traits. That is why an abstract machine that would oper ate purely on the level of language is an absurdity. It is clear that this dia grammatic component is in turn more profound than the transformational component: the creations-transformations of a regime of signs operate by the emergence of ever-new abstract machines. Finally, the last, properly  *machinic, *component is meant to show how abstract machines are effectu ated in concrete assemblages; it is these assemblages that give distinct form to traits of expression, but not without doing the same for traits of content—the two forms being in reciprocal presupposition, or having a necessary, unformed relation that once again prevents the form of expres sion from behaving as though it were self-sufficient (although it is indepen dent or distinct in a strictly formal way). Thus pragmatics (or schizoanalysis) can be represented by four circular components that bud and form rhizomes. (1) The generative component: the study of concrete mixed semiotics; their mixtures and variations. (2) The transformational component: the study of pure semiotics; their transformations-translations and the creation of new semiotics. (3) The diagrammatic component: the study of abstract machines, from the standpoint of semiotically unformed matters in relation to physically unformed matters. (4) The machinic com ponent: the study of the assemblages that effectuate abstract machines, simultaneously semiotizing matters of expression and physicalizing matters of content. Pragmatics as a whole would consist in this: making a *tracing *of the mixed semiotics, under the generative component; making the transfor mational *map *of the regimes, with their possibilities for translation and creation, for budding along the lines of the tracings; making the *diagram *of the abstract machines that are in play in each case, either as potentialities or as effective emergences; outlining the *program *of the assemblages that

For example, in considering a given "proposition," in other words, a ver bal aggregate defined syntactically, semantically, and logically as the expression of an individual or group ("I love you" or "I am jealous"), one would begin by asking to which "statement" this proposition corresponds in the group or individual (for the same proposition can be tied to com pletely different statements). This question means: What regime of signs is the proposition taken up by and without which its syntactical, semantic, and logical elements would remain totally empty universal conditions? What nonlinguistic element, or variable of enunciation, gives it consis tency? There is a presignifying "I love you" of the collective type in which, as Miller says, a dance weds all the women of the tribe; there is a counter-signifying "I love you" of the distributive and polemical type that has to do with war and relations of force (the "I love you" of Penthesilea and Achilles); there is an "I love you" that is addressed to a center of signifiance and uses interpretation to make a whole series of signifieds correspond to the signifying chain; and there is a postsignifying or passional "I love you" that constitutes a proceeding beginning from a point of subjectification, then another, and yet another. Similarly, the proposition "I am jealous" is clearly not the same statement in the passional regime of subjectification as in the paranoid regime of signifiance: these are two distinct delusions. Second, once it has been determined which statement the proposition corresponds to in a given group or individual at a given time, one would look into the possibilities not only of mixture but also of translation and transformation into another regime, or into statements belonging to other regimes; one would look at what passes and does not pass in such a transformation, what remains irreducible and what flows. Third, one could try to create new, as yet unknown statements for that proposition, even if the result were a patois of sensual delight, physical and semiotic systems in shreds, asubjective affects, signs without signifiance where syntax, semantics, and logic are in collapse. This research should go from the worst to the best since it would cover precious, metaphorical, or stultifying regimes as well as cries-whispers, feverish improvisations, becomings-animal, becomings-molecular, real transsexualities, continuums of intensity, con stitutions of bodies without organs . .. These two poles are inseparable; they entertain perpetual relations of transformation, conversion, jumping, falling, and rising. This final research simultaneously brings into play, on the one hand, abstract machines, diagrams and diagrammatic functions, and, on the other hand, machinic assemblages, the formal distinctions they make between expression and content, and their investments of words and organs according to a relation of reciprocal presupposition.

These questions apply as much to destratification as to the organization of strata. In short, there are no syntactically, semantically, or logically definable propositions that tran scend or loom above statements. All methods for the transcendentaliza-tion of language, all methods for endowing language with universals, from Russell's logic to Chomsky's grammar, have fallen into the worst kind of abstraction, in the sense that they validate a level that is both too abstract and not abstract enough. Regimes of signs are not based on language, and language alone does not constitute an abstract machine, whether structural or generative. The opposite is the case. It is language that is based on regimes of signs, and regimes of signs on abstract machines, diagrammatic functions, and machinic assemblages that go beyond any system of semiology, linguistics, or logic. There is no universal prepositional logic, nor is there grammaticality in itself, any more than there is signifier for itself. "Behind" statements and semioticizations there are only machines, assemblages, and movements of deterritorialization that cut across the stratification of the various systems and elude both the coordinates of language and of existence. That is why pragmatics is not a complement to logic, syntax, or semantics; on the contrary, it is the fundamental element upon which all the rest depend.

The BwO: it is already under way the moment the body has had enough of organs and wants to slough them off, or loses them. A long procession. The *hypochondriac body: *the organs are destroyed, the damage has already been done, nothing happens anymore. "Miss X claims that she no longer has a brain or nerves or chest or stomach or guts. All she has left is the skin and bones of a disorganized body. These are her own words." 2 The *para-* *noid body: *the organs are continually under attack by outside forces, but are also restored by outside energies. ("He lived for a long time without a stomach, without intestines, almost without lungs, with a torn oesophagus, without a bladder, and with shattered ribs, he used sometimes to swallow part of his own larynx with his food, etc. But divine miracles ('rays') always restored what had been destroyed.") 3 The *schizo body, *waging its own active internal struggle against the organs, at the price of catatonia. Then the *drugged body, *the experimental schizo: "The human body is scandal ously inefficient. Instead of a mouth and an anus to get out of order why not have one all-purpose hole to eat *and *eliminate? We could seal up nose and mouth, fill in the stomach, make an air hole direct into the lungs where it should have been in the first place." 4 The *masochist body: *it is poorly understood in terms of pain; it is fundamentally a question of the BwO. It has its sadist or whore sew it up; the eyes, anus, urethra, breasts, and nose are sewn shut. It has itself strung up to stop the organs from working; flayed, as if the organs clung to the skin; sodomized, smothered, to make sure everything is sealed tight. Why such a dreary parade of sucked-dry, catatonicized, vitrified, sewn-up bodies, when the BwO is also full of gaiety, ecstasy, and dance? So why these examples, why must we start there? Emptied bodies instead of full ones. What happened? Were you cautious enough? Not wisdom, cau tion. In doses. As a rule immanent to experimentation: injections of cau tion. Many have been defeated in this battle. Is it really so sad and dangerous to be fed up with seeing with your eyes, breathing with your

Why not walk on your head, sing with your sinuses, see through your skin, breathe with your belly: the simple Thing, the Entity, the full Body, the stationary Voyage, Anorexia, cutaneous Vision, Yoga, Krishna, Love, Experimentation. Where psychoanalysis says, "Stop, find your self again," we should say instead, "Let's go further still, we haven't found our BwO yet, we haven't sufficiently dismantled our self." Substitute forgetting for anamnesis, experimentation for interpretation. Find your body without organs. Find out how to make it. It's a question of life and death, youth and old age, sad ness and joy. It is where everything is played out. "Mistress, 1) You may tie me down on the table, ropes drawn tight, for ten to fifteen minutes, time enough to prepare the instruments; 2) One hundred lashes at least, a pause of several minutes; 3) You begin sewing, you sew up the hole in the glans; you sew the skin around the glans to the glans itself, preventing the top from tearing; you sew the scrotum to the skin of the thighs. You sew the breasts, securely attaching a button with four holes to each nipple. You may connect them with an elastic band with buttonholes—*Now you go on to the second phase: *4) You can choose either to turn me over on the table so I am tied lying on my stomach, but with my legs together, or to bind me to the post with my wrists together, and my legs also, my whole body tightly bound; 5) You whip my back buttocks thighs, a hundred lashes at least; 6) You sew my buttocks together, all the way up and down the crack of my ass. Tightly, with a doubled thread, each stitch knot ted. If I am on the table, now tie me to the post; 7) You give me fifty thrashes on the buttocks; 8) If you wish to intensify the torture and carry out your threat from last time, stick the pins all the way into my buttocks as far as they go; 9) Then you may tie me to the chair; you give me thirty thrashes on the breasts and stick in the smaller pins; if you wish, you may heat them red-hot beforehand, all or sorne. I should be tightly bound to the chair, hands behind my back so my chest sticks out. I haven't mentioned burns, only because I have a medical exam coming up in awhile, and they take a long time to heal." This is not a phantasy, it is a program: There is an essen tial difference between the psychoanalytic interpretation of the phantasy and the antipsychiatric experimentation of the program. Between the phantasy, an interpretation that must itself be interpreted, and the motor program of experimentation. 5 The BwO is what remains when you take everything away. What you take away is precisely the phantasy, and signifiances and subjectifications as a whole. Psychoanalysis does the opposite: it translates everything into phantasies, it converts everything into phantasy, it retains the phantasy. It royally botches the real, because it botches the BwO.

0 152 D HOW DO YOU MAKE YOURSELF A BODY WITHOUT ORGANS? Something will happen. Something is already happening. But what comes to pass on the BwO is not exactly the same as how you make yourself one. However, one is included in the other. Hence the two phases set forth in the preceding letter. *Why two clearly distinguished phases, *when the same thing is done in both cases—sewing and flogging? One phase is for the fabrication of the BwO, the other to make something circulate on it or pass across it; the same procedures are nevertheless used in both phases, but they must be done over, done twice. What is certain is that the masochist has made himself a BwO under such conditions that the BwO can no longer be populated by anything but intensities of pain, *pain waves. *It is false to say that the masochist is looking for pain but just as false to say that he is looking for pleasure in a particularly suspensive or roundabout way. The masochist is looking for a type of BwO that only pain can fill, or travel over, due to the very conditions under which that BwO was constituted. Pains are populations, packs, modes of king-masochist-in-the-desert that he engenders and augments. The same goes for the drugged body and intensi ties of cold, *refrigerator waves. *For each type of BwO, we must ask: (1) What type is it, how is it fabricated, by what procedures and means (predeter mining what will come to pass)? (2) What are its modes, what comes to pass, and with what variants and what surprises, what is unexpected and what expected? In short, there is a very special relation of synthesis and analysis between a given type of BwO and what happens on it: an *a priori * synthesis by which something will necessarily be produced in a given mode (but what it will be is not known) and an infinite analysis by which what is produced on the BwO is already part of that body's production, is already included in the body, is already on it (but at the price of an infinity of pas sages, divisions, and secondary productions). It is a very delicate experi mentation since there must not be any stagnation of the modes or slippage in type: the masochist and the drug user court these ever-present dangers that empty their BwO's instead of filling them. You can fail twice, but it is the same failure, the same danger. Once at the level of the constitution of the BwO and again at the level of what passes or does not pass across it. You think you have made yourself a good BwO, that you chose the right Place, Power *{Puissance), *and Collectivity (there is always a collectivity, even when you are alone), and then nothing passes, nothing circulates, or something prevents things from moving. A paranoid point, a point of blockage, an outburst of delirium: it comes across clearly in *Speed, *by William Burroughs, Jr. Is it possible to locate this danger point, should the block be expelled, or should one instead "love, honor, and serve degeneracy wherever it surfaces"? To block, to be blocked, is that not still an intensity? In each case, we must define what comes to pass and what does not pass, what causes passage and prevents it. As in the meat circuit

0 HOW DO YOU MAKE YOURSELF A BODY WITHOUT ORGANS? D 153 according to Lewin, something flows through channels whose sections are delimited by doors with gatekeepers, passers-on. 6 Door openers and trap closers, Malabars and Fierabras. The body is now nothing more than a set of valves, locks, floodgates, bowls, or communicating vessels, each with a proper name: a peopling of the BwO, a Metropolis that has to be managed with a whip. What peoples it, what passes across it, what does the blocking? A BwO is made in such a way that it can be occupied, populated only by intensities. Only intensities pass and circulate. Still, the BwO is not a scene, a place, or even a support upon which something comes to pass. It has noth ing to do with phantasy, there is nothing to interpret. The BwO causes intensities to pass; it produces and distributes them in a *spatium *that is itself intensive, lacking extension. It is not space, nor is it in space; it is mat ter that occupies space to a given degree—to the degree corresponding to the intensities produced. It is nonstratified, unformed, intense matter, the matrix of intensity, intensity = 0; but there is nothing negative about that zero, there are no negative or opposite intensities. Matter equals energy. Production of the real as an intensive magnitude starting at zero. That is why we treat the BwO as the full egg before the extension of the organism and the organization of the organs, before the formation of the strata; as the intense egg defined by axes and vectors, gradients and thresholds, by dynamic tendencies involving energy transformation and kinematic movements involving group displacement, by migrations: all independent of *accessory forms *because the organs appear and function here only as pure intensities. 7 The organ changes when it crosses a threshold, when it changes gradient. "No organ is constant as regards either function or posi tion, ... sex organs sprout anywhere,... rectums open, defecate and close, ... the entire organism changes color and consistency in split-second adjustments." 8 The tantric egg. After all, is not Spinoza's *Ethics *the great book of the BwO? The attri butes are types or genuses of BwO's, substances, powers, zero intensities as matrices of production. The modes are everything that comes to pass: waves and vibrations, migrations, thresholds and gradients, intensities produced in a given type of substance starting from a given matrix. The masochist body as an attribute or genus of substance, with its production of intensities and pain modes based on its degree 0 of being sewn up. The drugged body as a different attribute, with its production of specific inten sities based on absolute Cold = 0. ("Junkies always beef about *The Cold as * they call it, turning up their black coat collars and clutching their withered necks . . . pure junk con. A junky does not want to be warm, he wants to be cool-cooler-coLD. But he wants The Cold like he wants His Junk— NOT OUTSIDE where it does him no good but INSIDE so he can sit around with a spine like a frozen hydraulic jack... his metabolism approaching Absolute

The problem of whether there is a substance of all substances, a single substance for all attributes, becomes: *Is there a totality of all  BwO'sl *If the BwO is already a limit, what must we say of the totality of all BwO's? It is a problem not of the One and the Multiple but of a fusional multiplicity that effectively goes beyond any opposition between the one and the multiple. A formal multiplicity of substantial attributes that, as such, constitutes the ontological unity of substance. There is a continuum of all of the attributes or genuses of intensity under a single substance, and a continuum of the intensities of a certain genus under a single type or attribute. A continuum of all substances in intensity and of all intensities in substance. The uninterrupted continuum of the BwO. BwO, imma nence, immanent limit. Drug users, masochists, schizophrenics, lovers— all BwO's pay homage to Spinoza. The BwO is *the field of immanence *of desire, the *plane of consistency *specific to desire (with desire defined as a process of production without reference to any exterior agency, whether it be a lack that hollows it out or a pleasure that fills it). Every time desire is betrayed, cursed, uprooted from its field of immanence, a priest is behind it. The priest cast the triple curse on desire: the negative law, the extrinsic rule, and the transcendent ideal. Facing north, the priest said, Desire is lack (how could it not lack what it desires?). The priest carried out the first sacrifice, named castration, and all the men and women of the north lined up behind him, crying in cadence, "Lack, lack, it's the common law." Then, facing south, the priest linked desire to pleasure. For there are hedonistic, even orgiastic, priests. Desire will be assuaged by pleasure; and not only will the pleasure obtained silence desire for a moment but the process of obtaining it is already a way of interrupting it, of instantly discharging it and unburdening oneself of it. Pleasure as dis charge: the priest carries out the second sacrifice, named masturbation. Then, facing east, he exclaimed: *Jouissance *is impossible, but impossible  *jouissance *is inscribed in desire. For that, in its very impossibility, is the Ideal, the "*manque-a-jouir *that is life." 10 The priest carried out the third sacrifice, phantasy or the thousand and one nights, the one hundred twenty days, while the men of the East chanted: Yes, we will be your phantasy, your ideal and impossibility, yours and also our own. The priest did not turn to the west. He knew that in the west lay a plane of consistency, but he thought that the way was blocked by the columns of Hercules, that it led nowhere and was uninhabited by people. But that is where desire was lurking, west was the shortest route east, as well as to the other directions, rediscovered or deterritorialized. The most recent figure of the priest is the psychoanalyst, with his or her three principles: Pleasure, Death, and Reality. Doubtless, psychoanalysis demonstrated that desire is not subordinated to procreation, or even to

But it retained the essentials; it even found new ways of inscribing in desire the negative law of lack, the external rule of pleasure, and the transcendent ideal of phantasy. Take the interpre tation of masochism: when the ridiculous death instinct is not invoked, it is claimed that the masochist, like everybody else, is after pleasure but can only get it through pain and phantasied humiliations whose function is to allay or ward off deep anxiety. This is inaccurate; the masochist's suffering is the price he must pay, not to achieve pleasure, but to untie the pseudobond between desire and pleasure as an extrinsic measure. Pleasure is in no way something that can be attained only by a detour through suffer ing; it is something that must be delayed as long as possible because it inter rupts the continuous process of positive desire. There is, in fact, a joy that is immanent to desire as though desire were filled by itself and its contempla tions, a joy that implies no lack or impossibility and is not measured by pleasure since it is what distributes intensities of pleasure and prevents them from being suffused by anxiety, shame, and guilt. In short, the mas ochist uses suffering as a way of constituting a body without organs and bringing forth a plane of consistency of desire. That there are other ways, other procedures than masochism, and certainly better ones, is beside the point; it is enough that some find this procedure suitable for them. Take a masochist who did not undergo psychoanalysis: " PROGRAM . . . At night, put on the bridle and attach my hands more tightly, either to the bit with the chain, or to the big belt right after returning from the bath. Put on the entire harness right away also, the reins and thumbscrews, and attach the thumbscrews to the harness. My penis should be in a metal sheath. Ride the reins for two hours during the day, and in the evening as the master wishes. Confinement for three or four days, hands still tied, the reins alternately tightened and loosened. The master will never approach her horse without the crop, and without using it. If the animal should dis play impatience or rebelliousness, the reins will be drawn tighter, the mas ter will grab them and give the beast a good thrashing." 11 What is this masochist doing? He seems to be imitating a horse, *Equus eroticus, *but that's not it. Nor are the horse and the master-trainer or mistress images of the mother or father. Something entirely different is going on: a becoming-animal essential to masochism. It is a question of forces. The masochist presents it this way: *Training axiom*—*destroy the instinctive  forces in order to replace them with transmitted forces. *In fact, it is less a destruction than an exchange and circulation ("what happens to a horse can also happen to me"). Horses are trained: humans impose upon the horse's instinctive forces transmitted forces that regulate the former, select, dominate, overcode them. The masochist effects an inversion of signs: the horse transmits its transmitted forces to him, so that the masochist's innate

0 156 □ HOW DO YOU MAKE YOURSELF A BODY WITHOUT ORGANS? forces will in turn be tamed. There are two series, the horse's (innate force, force transmitted by the human being), and the masochist's (force trans mitted by the horse, innate force of the human being). One series explodes into the other, forms a circuit with it: an increase in power or a circuit of intensities. The "master," or rather the mistress-rider, the equestrian, ensures the conversion of forces and the inversion of signs. The masochist constructs an entire assemblage that simultaneously draws and fills the field of immanence of desire; he constitutes a body without organs or plane of consistency using himself, the horse, and the mistress. "Results to be obtained: that I am kept in continual expectancy of actions and orders, and that little by little all opposition is replaced by *a fusion *of my person with yours. ... Thus at the mere thought of your boots, without even acknowl edging it, I must feel fear. In this way, *it will no longer be women's legs that  have an effect on me, *and if it pleases you to command me to receive your caresses, when you have had them and if you make me feel them, you will give me the imprint of your body as I have never had it before and never would have had it otherwise."' 2 Legs are still organs, but the boots now only determine a zone of intensity as an imprint or zone on a BwO. Similarly, or actually in a different way, it would be an error to interpret courtly love in terms of a law of lack or an ideal of transcendence. The renunciation of external pleasure, or its delay, its infinite regress, testifies on the contrary to an achieved state in which desire no longer lacks any thing but fills itself and constructs its own field of immanence. Pleasure is an affection of a person or a subject; it is the only way for persons to "find themselves" in the process of desire that exceeds them; pleasures, even the most artificial, are reterritorializations. But the question is precisely whether it is necessary to find oneself. Courtly love does not love the self, any more than it loves the whole universe in a celestial or religious way. It is a question of making a body without organs upon which intensities pass, self and other—not in the name of a higher level of generality or a broader extension, but by virtue of singularities that can no longer be said to be per sonal, and intensities that can no longer be said to be extensive. The field of immanence is not internal to the self, but neither does it come from an external self or a nonself. Rather, it is like the absolute Outside that knows no Selves because interior and exterior are equally a part of the immanence in which they have fused. "Joy" in courtly love, the exchange of hearts, the test or "assay": everything is allowed, as long as it is not external to desire or transcendent to its plane, or else internal to persons. The slightest caress may be as strong as an orgasm; orgasm is a mere fact, a rather deplorable one, in relation to desire in pursuit of its principle. Everything is allowed: all that counts is for pleasure to be the flow of desire itself, Immanence, instead of a measure that interrupts it or delivers it to the three phantoms,

D 157 namely, internal lack, higher transcendence, and apparent exteriority. 13 If pleasure is not the norm of desire, it is not by virtue of a lack that is impossi ble to fill but, on the contrary, by virtue of its positivity, in other words, the plane of consistency it draws in the course of its process. A great Japanese compilation of Chinese Taoist treatises was made in A . D . 982-984. We see in it the formation of a circuit of intensities between female and male energy, with the woman playing the role of the innate or instinctive force (Yin) stolen by or transmitted to the man in such a way that the transmitted force of the man (Yang) in turn becomes innate, all the more innate: an augmentation of powers. 14 The condition for this circula tion and multiplication is that the man not ejaculate. It is not a question of experiencing desire as an internal lack, nor of delaying pleasure in order to produce a kind of externalizable surplus value, but instead of constituting an intensive body without organs, Tao, a field of immanence in which desire lacks nothing and therefore cannot be linked to any external or tran scendent criterion. It is true that the whole circuit can be channeled toward procreative ends (ejaculation when the energies are right); that is how Con fucianism understood it. But this is true only for one side of the assemblage of desire, the side facing the strata, organisms, State, family... It is not true for the other side, the Tao side of destratification that draws a plane of consistency proper to desire. Is the Tao masochistic? Is courtly love Taoist? These questions are largely meaningless. The field of immanence or plane of consistency must be constructed. This can take place in very different social formations through very different assemblages (perverse, artistic, scientific, mystical, political) with different types of bodies without organs. It is constructed piece by piece, and the places, conditions, and techniques are irreducible to one another. The question, rather, is whether the pieces can fit together, and at what price. Inevitably, there will be mon strous crossbreeds. The plane of consistency would be the totality of all BwO's, a pure multiplicity of immanence, one piece of which may be Chi nese, another American, another medieval, another petty perverse, but all in a movement of generalized deterritorialization in which each person takes and makes what she or he can, according to tastes she or he will have succeeded in abstracting from a Self *[Moi], *according to a politics or strat egy successfully abstracted from a given formation, according to a given procedure abstracted from its origin. We distinguish between: (1) BwO's, which are different types, genuses, or substantial attributes. For example, the Cold of the drugged BwO, the Pain of the masochist BwO. Each has its degree 0 as its principle of produc tion *(remissio). *(2) What happens on each type of BwO, in other words, the modes, the intensities that are produced, the waves that pass *(latitudo). *(3) The potential totality of all BwO's, the plane of consistency *(Omnitudo,*

0 158 □ HOW DO YOU MAKE YOURSELF A BODY WITHOUT ORGANS? sometimes called the BwO). There are a number of questions. Not only how to make oneself a BwO, and how to produce the corresponding intensities without which it would remain empty (not exactly the same question). But also how to reach the plane of consistency. How to sew up, cool down, and tie together all the BwO's. If this is possible to do, it is only by conjugating the intensities produced on each BwO, by producing a con tinuum of all intensive continuities. Are not assemblages necessary to fab ricate each BwO, is not a great abstract Machine necessary to construct the plane of consistency? Gregory Bateson uses the term *plateau *for continu ous regions of intensity constituted in such a way that they do not allow themselves to be interrupted by any external termination, any more than they allow themselves to build toward a climax; examples are certain sex ual, or aggressive, processes in Balinese culture. 15 A plateau is a piece of immanence. Every BwO is made up of plateaus. Every BwO is itself a pla teau in communication with other plateaus on the plane of consistency. The BwO is a component of passage. A rereading of *H'eliogabale *and *Les Tarahumaras. *For Heliogabalus is Spinoza, and Spinoza is Heliogabalus revived. And the Tarahumaras are experimentation, peyote. Spinoza, Heliogabalus, and experimentation have the same formula: anarchy and unity are one and the same thing, not the unity of the One, but a much stranger unity that applies only to the mul tiple. 16 These two books by Artaud express the multiplicity of fusion, fusionability as infinite zero, the plane of consistency, Matter where no gods go; principles as forces, essences, substances, elements, remissions, productions; manners of being or modalities as produced intensities, vibrations, breaths, Numbers. Finally, the difficulty of reaching this world of crowned Anarchy if you go no farther than the organs ("the liver that turns the skin yellow, the brain wracked by syphilis, the intestines that expel filth") and if you stay locked into the organism, or into a stratum that blocks the flows and anchors us in this, our world. We come to the gradual realization that the BwO is not at all the opposite of the organs. The organs are not its enemies. The enemy is the organism. The BwO is opposed not to the organs but to that organization of the organs called the organism. It is true that Artaud wages a struggle against the organs, but at the same time what he is going after, what he has it in for, is the organism: *The body is the body. Alone it stands. And in no need of  organs. Organism it never is. Organisms are the enemies of the body.* *11* * *The BwO is not opposed to the organs; rather, the BwO and its "true organs," which must be composed and positioned, are opposed to the organism, the organic organization of the organs. *The judgment of God, *the system of the judgment of God, the theological system, is precisely the operation of He who makes an organism, an organization of organs called the organism,

0 HOW DO YOU MAKE YOURSELF A BODY WITHOUT ORGANS? D 159 because He cannot bear the BwO, because He pursues it and rips it apart so He can be first, and have the organism be first. The organism is already that, the judgment of God, from which medical doctors benefit and on which they base their power. The organism is not at all the body, the BwO; rather, it is a stratum on the BwO, in other words, a phenomenon of accu mulation, coagulation, and sedimentation that, in order to extract useful labor from the BwO, imposes upon it forms, functions, bonds, dominant and hierarchized organizations, organized transcendences. The strata are bonds, pincers. "Tie me up if you wish." We are continually stratified. But who is this we that is not me, for the subject no less than the organism belongs to and depends on a stratum? Now we have the answer: the BwO is that glacial reality where the alluvions, sedimentations, coagulations, foldings, and recoilings that compose an organism—and also a significa tion and a subject—occur. For the judgment of God weighs upon and is exercised against the BwO; it is the BwO that undergoes it. It is in the BwO that the organs enter into the relations of composition called the organism. The BwO howls: "They've made me an organism! They've wrongfully folded me! They've stolen my body!" The judgment of God uproots it from its immanence and makes it an organism, a signification, a subject. It is the BwO that is stratified. It swings between two poles, the surfaces of stratifi cation into which it is recoiled, on which it submits to the judgment, and the plane of consistency in which it unfurls and opens to experimentation. If the BwO is a limit, if one is forever attaining it, it is because behind each stratum, encasted in it, there is always another stratum. For many a stra tum, and not only an organism, is necessary to make the judgment of God. A perpetual and violent combat between the plane of consistency, which frees the BwO, cutting across and dismantling all of the strata, and the sur faces of stratification that block it or make it recoil. Let us consider the three great strata concerning us, in other words, the ones that most directly bind us: the organism, signifiance, and subjectifi-cation. The surface of the organism, the angle of signifiance and interpretation, and the point of subjectification or subjection. You will be organized, you will be an organism, you will articulate your body—otherwise you're just depraved. You will be signifier and signified, interpreter and interpreted—otherwise you're just a deviant. You will be a subject, nailed down as one, a subject of the enunciation recoiled into a subject of the statement—otherwise you're just a tramp. To the strata as a whole, the BwO opposes disarticulation (or *n * articulations) as the property of the plane of consistency, experimentation as the operation on that plane (no signifier, never interpret!), and nomadism as the movement (keep moving, even in place, never stop moving, motionless voyage, desubjectification). What does it mean to disarticulate, to cease to be an organism? How can we

160 D HOW DO YOU MAKE YOURSELF A BODY WITHOUT ORGANS? convey how easy it is, and the extent to which we do it every day? And how necessary caution is, the art of dosages, since overdose is a danger. You don't do it with a sledgehammer, you use a very fine file. You invent self-destructions that have nothing to do with the death drive. Dismantling the organism has never meant killing yourself, but rather opening the body to connections that presuppose an entire assemblage, circuits, conjunctions, levels and thresholds, passages and distributions of intensity, and territories and deterritorializations measured with the craft of a surveyor. Actually, dismantling the organism is no more difficult than dismantling the other two strata, signifiance and subjectification. Signifiance clings to the soul just as the organism clings to the body, and it is not easy to get rid of either. And how can we unhook ourselves from the points of subjectification that secure us, nail us down to a dominant reality? Tearing the conscious away from the subject in order to make it a means of exploration, tearing the unconscious away from signifiance and interpretation in order to make it a veritable production: this is assuredly no more or less difficult than tearing the body away from the organism. Caution is the art common to all three; if in dismantling the organism there are times one courts death, in slipping away from signifiance and subjection one courts falsehood, illusion and hallucination and psychic death. Artaud weighs and measures every word: the conscious "knows what is good for it and what is of no value to it: it knows which thoughts and feelings it can receive without danger and with profit, and which are harmful to the exercise of its freedom. Above all, it knows just how far its own being goes, and just how far it has not yet gone or does not have the right to go without sinking into the unreal, the illusory, the unmade, the unprepared ... a *Plane *which normal consciousness does not reach but which *Ciguri * allows us to reach, and which is the very mystery of all poetry. But there is in human existence another plane, obscure and formless, where consciousness has not entered, and which surrounds it like an unilluminated extension or a menace, as the case may be. And which itself gives off adventurous sensations, perceptions. These are those shameless fantasies which affect an unhealthy conscious. ... I too have had false sensations and perceptions and I have believed in them." 18 You have to keep enough of the organism for it to reform each dawn; and you have to keep small supplies of signifiance and subjectification, if only to turn them against their own systems when the circumstances demand it, when things, persons, even situations, force you to; and you have to keep small rations of subjectivity in sufficient quantity to enable you to respond to the dominant reality. Mimic the strata. You don't reach the BwO, and its plane of consistency, by wildly destratifying. That is why we encountered the paradox of those emptied and dreary bodies at the very beginning: *they*

There are, in fact, several ways of botching the BwO: either one fails to produce it, or one produces it more or less, but nothing is produced on it, intensities do not pass or are blocked. This is because the BwO is always swinging between the surfaces that stratify it and the plane that sets it free. If you free it with too violent an action, if you blow apart the strata without taking precautions, then instead of drawing the plane you will be killed, plunged into a black hole, or even dragged toward catastrophe. Staying stratified—organized, signified, subjected— is not the worst that can happen; the worst that can happen is if you throw the strata into demented or suicidal collapse, which brings them back down on us heavier than ever. This is how it should be done: Lodge yourself on a stratum, experiment with the opportunities it offers, find an advantageous place on it, find potential movements of deterritorialization, possible lines of flight, experience them, produce flow conjunctions here and there, try out continuums of intensities segment by segment, have a small plot of new land at all times. It is through a meticulous relation with the strata that one succeeds in freeing lines of flight, causing conjugated flows to pass and escape and bringing forth continuous intensities for a BwO. Connect, con jugate, continue: a whole "diagram," as opposed to still signifying and sub jective programs. We are in a social formation; first see how it is stratified for us and in us and at the place where we are; then descend from the strata to the deeper assemblage within which we are held; gently tip the assem blage, making it pass over to the side of the plane of consistency. It is only there that the BwO reveals itself for what it is: connection of desires, con junction of flows, continuum of intensities. You have constructed your own little machine, ready when needed to be plugged into other collective machines. Castaneda describes a long process of experimentation (it makes little difference whether it is with peyote or other things): let us recall for the moment how the Indian forces him first to find a "place," already a difficult operation, then to find "allies," and then gradually to give up interpretation, to construct flow by flow and segment by segment lines of experimentation, becoming-animal, becoming-molecular, etc. For the BwO is all of that: necessarily a Place, necessarily a Plane, necessarily a Collectivity (assembling elements, things, plants, animals, tools, people, powers, and fragments of all of these; for it is not "my" body without organs, instead the "me" *(moi) *is on it, or what remains of me, unalterable and changing in form, crossing thresholds). In the course of Castaneda's books, the reader may begin to doubt the existence of the Indian Don Juan, and many other things besides. But that has no importance. So much the better if the books are a syncretism rather

162 □ HOW DO YOU MAKE YOURSELF A BODY WITHOUT ORGANS? than an ethnographical study, and the protocol of an experiment rather than an account of an initiation. The fourth book, *Tales of Power, *is about the living distinction between the "Tonal" and the "Nagual." The *tonal * seems to cover many disparate things: It is the organism, and also all that is organized and organizing; but it is also signifiance, and all that is signifying or signified, all that is susceptible to interpretation, explanation, all that is memorizable in the form of something recalling something else; finally, it is the Self *(Moi), *the subject, the historical, social, or individual person, and the corresponding feelings. In short, the tonal is everything, including God, the judgment of God, since it "makes up the rules by which it appre hends the world. So, in a manner of speaking, it creates the world." 19 Yet the tonal is only an island. For the *nagual *is also everything. And it is the same everything, but under such conditions that the body without organs has replaced the organism and experimentation has replaced all interpreta tion, for which it no longer has any use. Flows of intensity, their fluids, their fibers, their continuums and conjunctions of affects, the wind, fine segmentation, microperceptions, have replaced the world of the subject. Becomings, becomings-animal, becomings-molecular, have replaced his tory, individual or general. In fact, the tonal is not as disparate as it seems: it includes all of the strata and everything that can be ascribed to the strata, the organization of the organism, the interpretations and explanations of the signifiable, the movements of subjectification. The nagual, on the con trary, dismantles the strata. It is no longer an organism that functions but a BwO that is constructed. No longer are there acts to explain, dreams or phantasies to interpret, childhood memories to recall, words to make sig nify; instead, there are colors and sounds, becomings and intensities (and when you become-dog, don't ask if the dog you are playing with is a dream or a reality, if it is "your goddam mother" or something else entirely). There is no longer a Self *[Moi] *that feels, acts, and recalls; there is "a glowing fog, a dark yellow mist" that has affects and experiences movements, speeds. 20 The important thing is not to dismantle the tonal by destroying it all of a sudden. You have to diminish it, shrink it, clean it, and that only at certain moments. You have to keep it in order to survive, to ward off the assault of the nagual. For a nagual that erupts, that destroys the tonal, a body without organs that shatters all the strata, turns immediately into a body of noth ingness, pure self-destruction whose only outcome is death: "The tonal must be protected at any cost." 21 We still have not answered the question of why there are so many dan gers, and so many necessary precautions. It is not enough to set up an abstract opposition between the strata and the BwO. For the BwO already exists in the strata as well as on the destratified plane of consistency, but in a totally different manner. Take the organism as a stratum: there is indeed a

Take the stratum of signifiance: once again, there is a cancerous tissue, this time of signifiance, a burgeon ing body of the despot that blocks any circulation of signs, as well as preventing the birth of the asignifying sign on the "other" BwO. Or take a stifling body of subjectification, which makes a freeing all the more unlikely by forbidding any remaining distinction between subjects. Even if we consider given social formations, or a given stratic apparatus within a formation, we must say that every one of them has a BwO ready to gnaw, proliferate, cover, and invade the entire social field, entering into relations of violence and rivalry as well as alliance and complicity. A BwO of money (inflation), but also a BwO of the State, army, factory, city, Party, etc. If the strata are an affair of coagulation and sedimentation, all a stratum needs is a high sedimentation rate for it to lose its configuration and articulations, and to form its own specific kind of tumor, within itself or in a given forma tion or apparatus. The strata spawn their own BwO's, totalitarian and fas cist BwO's, terrifying caricatures of the plane of consistency. It is not enough to make a distinction between full BwO's on the plane of consis tency and empty BwO's on the debris of strata destroyed by a too-violent destratification. We must also take into account cancerous BwO's in a stra tum that has begun to proliferate. *The three-body problem. *Artaud said that outside the "plane" is another plane surrounding us with "an unillu-minated extension or a menace, as the case may be." It is a struggle and as such is never sufficiently clear. How can we fabricate a BwO for ourselves without its being the cancerous BwO of a fascist inside us, or the empty BwO of a drug addict, paranoiac, or hypochondriac? How can we tell the three Bodies apart? Artaud was constantly grappling with this problem. The extraordinary composition of *To Be Done with the  Judgment of God: *he begins by cursing the cancerous body of America, the body of war and money; he denounces the strata, which he calls "caca"; to the strata he opposes the true Plane, even if it is only peyote, the little trickle of the Tarahumaras; but he also knows about the dangers of a too-sudden, careless destratification. Artaud was constantly grappling with all of that, and flowed with it. *Letter to Hitler: *"Dear Sir, In 1932 in the Ider Cafe in Berlin, on one of the evenings when I made your acquaintance and shortly before you took power, I showed you roadblocks on *a map that  was not just a map of geography, *roadblocks against me, an act of force aimed in a certain

Be it under stood, dear sir, that this is hardly an invitation, it is above all a warning." 22 That map that is not only a map of geography is something like a BwO intensity map, where the roadblocks designate thresholds and the gas, waves or flows. Even if Artaud did not succeed for himself, it is certain that through him something has succeeded for us all. The BwO is the egg. But the egg is not regressive; on the contrary, it is perfectly contemporary, you always carry it with you as your own milieu of experimentation, your associated milieu. The egg is the milieu of pure intensity, spatium not extension, Zero intensity as principle of production. There is a fundamental convergence between science and myth, embryol ogy and mythology, the biological egg and the psychic or cosmic egg: the egg always designates this intensive reality, which is not undifferentiated, but is where things and organs are distinguished solely by gradients, migra tions, zones of proximity. The egg is the BwO. The BwO is not "before" the organism; it is adjacent to it and is continually in the process of construct ing itself. If it is tied to childhood, it is not in the sense that the adult regresses to the child and the child to the Mother, but in the sense that the child, like the Dogon twin who takes a piece of the placenta with him, tears from the organic form of the Mother an intense and destratified matter that on the contrary constitutes his or her perpetual break with the past, his or her present experience, experimentation. The BwO is a childhood block, a becoming, the opposite of a childhood memory. It is not the child "before" the adult, or the mother "before" the child: it is the strict contem poraneousness of the adult, of the adult and the child, their map of compar ative densities and intensities, and all of the variations on that map. The BwO is precisely this intense germen where there are not and cannot be either parents or children (organic representation). This is what Freud failed to understand about Weissmann: the child as the germinal contem porary of its parents. Thus the BwO is never yours or mine. It is always *a * body. It is no more projective than it is regressive. It is an involution, but always a contemporary, creative involution. The organs distribute them selves on the BwO, but they distribute themselves independently of the form of the organism; forms become contingent, organs are no longer any thing more than intensities that are produced, flows, thresholds, and gradi ents. "A" stomach, "an" eye, "a" mouth: the indefinite article does not lack anything; it is not indeterminate or undifferentiated, but expresses the pure determination of intensity, intensive difference. The indefinite arti cle is the conductor of desire. It is not at all a question of a fragmented, splintered body, of organs without the body (OwB). The BwO is exactly the opposite. There are not organs in the sense of fragments in relation to a lost

There is a distribution of intensive principles of organs, with their positive indefinite articles, within a collectivity or multiplicity, inside an assemblage, and according to machinic connections operating on a BwO. *Logos spermaticos. *The error of psychoanalysis was to understand BwO phenomena as regressions, projections, phantasies, in terms of an *image *of the body. As a result, it only grasps the flipside of the BwO and immediately substitutes family photos, childhood memories, and part-objects for a worldwide intensity map. It understands nothing about the egg nor about indefinite articles nor about the contemporaneousness of a continually self-constructing milieu. The BwO is desire; it is that which one desires and by which one de sires. And not only because it is the plane of consistency or the field of immanence of desire. Even when it falls into the void of too-sudden destra-tification, or into the proliferation of a cancerous stratum, it is still desire. Desire stretches that far: desiring one's own annihilation, or desiring the power to annihilate. Money, army, police, and State desire, fascist desire, even fascism is desire. There is desire whenever there is the constitution of a BwO under one relation or another. It is a problem not of ideology but of pure matter, a phenomenon of physical, biological, psychic, social, or cosmic matter. That is why the material problem confronting schizoanalysis is knowing whether we have it within our means to make the selection, to distinguish the BwO from its doubles: empty vitreous bodies, cancerous bodies, totalitarian and fascist. The test of desire: not denouncing false desires, but distinguishing within desire between that which pertains to stratic proliferation, or else too-violent destratification, and that which pertains to the construction of the plane of consistency (keep an eye out for all that is fascist, even inside us, and also for the suicidal and the demented). The plane of consistency is not simply that which is constituted by the sum of all BwO's. There are things it rejects; the BwO chooses, as a function of the abstract machine that draws it. Even within a BwO (the masochist body, the drugged body, etc.), we must distinguish what can be composed on the plane and what cannot. There is a fascist use of drugs, or a suicidal use, but is there also a possible use that would be in conformity with the plane of consistency? Even paranoia: Is there a possibility of using it that way in part? When we asked the question of the totality of all BwO's, considered as substantial attributes of a single substance, it should have been understood, strictly speaking, to apply only to the plane. The plane is the totality of the full BwO's that have been selected (there is no positive totality including the cancerous or empty bodies). What is the nature of this totality? Is it solely logical? Or must we say that each BwO, from a basis in its own genus, produces effects identical or analogous to the effects other

Could what the drug user or masochist obtains also be obtained in a different fashion in the conditions of the plane, so it would even be possible to use drugs without using drugs, to get soused on pure water, as in Henry Miller's experimentations? Or is it a question of a real passage of substances, an intensive continuum of all the BwO's? Doubtless, anything is possible. All we are saying is that the iden tity of effects, the continuity of genera, the totality of all BwO's, can be obtained on the plane of consistency only by means of an abstract machine capable of covering and even creating it, by assemblages capable of plug ging into desire, of effectively taking charge of desires, of assuring their continuous connections and transversal tie-ins. Otherwise, the BwO's of the plane will remain separated by genus, marginalized, reduced to means of bordering, while on the "other plane" the emptied or cancerous doubles will triumph.

0 7\.  Year Zero: Faciality Earlier, we encountered two axes, signifiance and subjectification. We saw  that they were two very different semiotic systems, or even two strata.  Signifiance is never without a white wall upon which it inscribes its signs  and redundancies. Subjectification is never without a black hole in which  it lodges its consciousness, passion, and redundancies. Since all semiotics  are mixed and strata come at least in twos, it should come as no surprise  that a very special mechanism is situated at their intersection. Oddly  enough, it is a face: the *white wall/black hole *system. A broad face with  white cheeks, a chalk face with eyes cut in for a black hole. Clown head,  white clown, moon-white mime, angel of death, Holy Shroud. The face is  not an envelope exterior to the person who speaks, thinks, or feels. The  form of the signifier in language, even its units, would remain indetermi-  nate if the potential listener did not use the face of the speaker to guide his  or her choices ("Hey, he seems angry ..."; "He couldn't say it..."; "You  see my face when I'm talking to you ..."; "look at me carefully...").

0 168 D YEAR ZERO: FACIALITY child, woman, mother, man, father, boss, teacher, police officer, does not speak a general language but one whose signifying traits are indexed to spe cific faciality traits. Faces are not basically individual; they define zones of frequency or probability, delimit a field that neutralizes in advance any expressions or connections unamenable to the appropriate significations. Similarly, the form of subjectivity, whether consciousness or passion, would remain absolutely empty if faces did not form loci of resonance that select the sensed or mental reality and make it conform in advance to a dominant reality. The face itself is redundancy. It is itself in redundancy with the redundancies of signifiance or frequency, and those of resonance or subjectivity. The face constructs the wall that the signifier needs in order to bounce off of; it constitutes the wall of the signifier, the frame or screen. The face digs the hole that subjectification needs in order to break through; it constitutes the black hole of subjectivity as consciousness or passion, the camera, the third eye. Or should we say things differently? It is not exactly the face that consti tutes the wall of the signifier or the hole of subjectivity. The face, at least the concrete face, vaguely begins to take shape *on *the white wall. It vaguely begins to appear *in *the black hole. In film, the close-up of the face can be said to have two poles: make the face reflect light or, on the contrary, emphasize its shadows to the point of engulfing it "in pitiless darkness." 1 A psychologist once said that the face is a visual percept that crystallizes out of "different varieties of vague luminosity without form or dimension." A suggestive whiteness, a hole that captures, a face. According to this account, the dimensionless black hole and formless white wall are already there to begin with. And there are already a number of possible combina tions in the system: either black holes distribute themselves on the white wall, or the white wall unravels and moves toward a black hole combining all black holes, hurtling them together or making them "crest." Sometimes faces appear on the wall, with their holes; sometimes they appear in the hole, with their linearized, rolled-up wall. A horror story, the face is a hor ror story. It is certain that the signifier does not construct the wall that it needs all by itself; it is certain that subjectivity does not dig its hole all alone. Concrete faces cannot be assumed to come ready-made. They are engendered by an *abstract machine of faciality (visageite), *which produces them at the same time as it gives the signifier its white wall and subjectivity its black hole. Thus the black hole/white wall system is, to begin with, not a face but the abstract machine that produces faces according to the change able combinations of its cogwheels.

Kafka's novella, "Blumfeld": 2 the bachelor returns home in the evening to find two little ping-pong balls jumping around by themselves on the "wall" constituted by the floor. They bounce everywhere and even try to hit him in the face. They apparently contain other, still smaller, electric balls. Blumfeld finally manages to lock them up in the black hole of a wardrobe. The scene contin ues the next day when Blumfeld tries to give the balls to a small, feeble minded boy and two grimacing little girls, and then at the office, where he encounters his two grimacing and feebleminded assistants, who want to make off with a broom. In a wonderful ballet by Debussy and Nijinsky, a little tennis ball comes bouncing onto the stage at dusk, and at the end another ball appears in a similar fashion. This time, between the two balls, two girls and a boy who watches them develop passional dance and facial traits in vague luminosities (curiosity, spite, irony, ecstasy. . .). 3 There is nothing to explain, nothing to interpret. It is the pure abstract machine of a twilight state. White wall/black hole? But depending on the combinations, the wall could just as well be black, and the hole white. The balls can bounce off of a wall or spin into a black hole. Even upon impact they can have the relative role of a hole in relation to the wall, just as when they are rolling straight ahead they can have the relative role of a wall in relation to the hole they are heading for. They circulate in the white wall/black hole system. Nothing in all of this resembles a face, yet throughout the system faces are distributed and faciality traits organized. Nevertheless, the abstract machine can be effectuated in other things besides faces, but not in any order, and not without the necessary foundation *(raisons).* The face has been a major concern of American psychology, in particu lar the relation between the mother and the child through eye-to-eye con tact. Four-eye machine? Let us recall certain stages in the research: (1) Isakower's studies on falling asleep, in which so-called proprioceptive sen sations of a manual, buccal, cutaneous, or even vaguely visual nature recall the infantile mouth-breast relation. (2) Lewin's discovery of a *white screen * of the dream, which is ordinarily covered by visual contents but remains white when the only dream contents are proprioceptive sensations (this screen or white wall, once again, is the breast as it approaches, getting larger and then pressing flat). (3) Spitz's interpretation according to which the white screen, rather than being a representation of the breast itself as an object of tactile sensation or contact, is a visual percept implying a mini mum of distance and upon which the mother's face appears for the child to use as a guide in finding the breast. Thus there is a combination of two very different kinds of elements: manual, buccal, or cutaneous proprioceptive sensations; and the visual perception of the face seen from the front against the white screen, with the shape of the eyes drawn in for black holes.

0 170 □ YEAR ZERO: FACIALITY visual perception very quickly assumes decisive importance for the act of eating, in relation to the breast as a volume and the mouth as a cavity, both experienced through touch. 4 We can now propose the following distinction: the face is part of a surface-holes, holey surface, system. This system should under no cir cumstances be confused with the volume-cavity system proper to the (proprioceptive) body. The head is included in the body, but the face is not. The face is a surface: facial traits, lines, wrinkles; long face, square face, tri angular face; the face is a map, even when it is applied to and wraps a vol ume, even when it surrounds and borders cavities that are now no more than holes. The head, even the human head, is not necessarily a face. The face is produced only when the head ceases to be a part of the body, when it ceases to be coded by the body, when it ceases to have a multidimensional, polyvocal corporeal code—when the body, head included, has been decoded and has to be *overcoded*'by something we shall call the Face. This amounts to saying that the head, all the volume-cavity elements of the head, have to be facialized. What accomplishes this is the screen with holes, the white wall/black hole, the abstract machine producing faciality. But the operation does not end there: if the head and its elements are facialized, the entire body also can be facialized, comes to be facialized as part of an inevi table process. When the mouth and nose, but first the eyes, become a holey surface, all the other volumes and cavities of the body follow. An operation worthy of Doctor Moreau: horrible and magnificent. Hand, breast, stom ach, penis and vagina, thigh, leg and foot, all come to be facialized. Fetish ism, erotomania, etc., are inseparable from these processes of facializa-tion. It is not at all a question of taking a part of the body and making it *resemble *a face, or making a dream-face dance in a cloud. No anthropomorphism here. Facialization operates not by resemblance but by an order of reasons. It is a much more unconscious and machinic operation that draws the entire body across the holey surface, and in which the role of the face is not as a model or image, but as an overcoding of all of the decoded parts. Everything remains sexual; there is no sublimation, but there are new coordinates. *It is precisely because the face depends on  an abstract machine that it is not content to cover the head, *but touches all other parts of the body, and even, if necessary, other objects without resemblance. *The question then becomes what circumstances trigger the  machine *that produces the face and facialization. Although the head, even the human head, is not necessarily a face, the face is produced in humanity. But it is produced by a necessity that does not apply to human beings "in general." The face is not animal, but neither is it human in general; there is even something absolutely inhuman about the face. It would be an error to proceed as though the face became inhuman only beyond a certain threshold: close

It is by nature a close-up, with its inanimate white surfaces, its shining black holes, its emptiness and boredom. Bunker-face. To the point that if human beings have a destiny, it is rather to escape the face, to dismantle the face and facializations, to become imperceptible, to become clandestine, not by returning to animality, nor even by returning to the head, but by quite spiritual and special becomings-animal, by strange true becomings that get past the wall and get out of the black holes, that *make faciality traits * themselves finally elude the organization of the face—freckles dashing toward the horizon, hair carried off by the wind, eyes you traverse instead of seeing yourself in or gazing into in those glum face-to-face encounters between signifying subjectivities. "I no longer look into the eyes of the woman I hold in my arms but I swim through, head and arms and legs, and I see that behind the sockets of the eyes there is a region unexplored, the world of futurity, and here there is no logic whatsoever. ... I have broken the wall. . .. My eyes are useless, for they render back only the image of the known. My whole body must become a constant beam of light, moving with an ever greater rapidity, never arrested, never looking back, never dwindling.... *Therefore I close my ears, my eyes, my mouth."* *5* * *BwO. Yes, the face has a great future, but only if it is destroyed, dismantled. On the road to the asignifying and asubjective. But so far we have explained nothing of what we sense. The move from the body-head system to the face system has nothing to do with an evolution or genetic stages. Nor with phenomenological posi tions. Nor with integrations of part-objects, or structural or structuring sys tems. Nor can there be any appeal to a preexisting subject, or one brought into existence, except by this machine specific to faciality. In the literature of the face, Sartre's text on the look and Lacan's on the mirror make the error of appealing to a form of subjectivity or humanity reflected in a phenomenological field or split in a structural field. *The gaze is but secon-  dary in relation to thegazeless eyes, to the black hole of faciality. The mirror  is but secondary in relation to the white wall of faciality. *Neither will we speak of a genetic axis, or the integration of part-objects. Any approach based on stages in ontogenesis is arbitrary: it is thought that what is fastest is primary, or even serves as a foundation or springboard for what comes next. An approach based on part-objects is even worse; it is the approach of a demented experimenter who flays, slices, and anatomizes everything in sight, and then proceeds to sew things randomly back together again. You can make any list of part-objects you want: hand, breast, mouth, eyes... It's still Frankenstein.

It becomes apparent that the slowest of movements, or the last to occur or arrive, is not the least intense. And the fastest may already have converged with it, connected with it, in the disequilibrium of a nonsynchronic devel opment of strata that have different speeds and lack a sequence of stages but are nevertheless simultaneous. The question of the body is not one of part-objects but of differential speeds. These movements are movements of deterritorialization. They are what "make" the body an animal or human organism. For example, the prehen sile hand implies a *relative *deterritorialization not only of the front paw but also of the locomotor hand. It has a correlate, the use-object or tool: the club is a deterritorialized branch. The breast of the woman, with her up right posture, indicates a deterritorialization of the animal's mammary gland; the mouth of the child, adorned with lips by an outfolding of the mucous membranes, marks a deterritorialization of the snout and mouth of the animal. Lips-breast: each serves as a correlate of the other. 6 The human head implies a deterritorialization in relation to the animal and has as its correlate the organization of a world, in other words, a milieu that has itself been deterritorialized (the steppe is the first "world," in contrast to the forest milieu). But the face represents a far more intense, if slower, deterritorialization. We could say that it is an *absolute *deterritorialization: it is no longer relative because it removes the head from the stratum of the organism, human or animal, and connects it to other strata, such as signi-fiance and subjectification. Now the face has a correlate of great importance: the landscape, which is not just a milieu but a deterritorialized world. There are a number of face-landscape correlations, on this "higher" level. Christian education exerts spiritual control over both faciality and landscapity *(paysageit'e): *Compose them both, color them in, complete them, arrange them according to a complementarity linking landscapes to faces. 7 Face and landscape manuals formed a pedagogy, a strict discipline, and were an inspiration to the arts as much as the arts were an inspiration to them. Architecture positions its ensembles—houses, towns or cities, monuments or factories—to function like faces in the landscape they transform. Painting takes up the same movement but also reverses it, positioning a landscape as a face, treating one like the other: "treatise on the face and the landscape." The close-up in film treats the face primarily as a landscape; that is the definition of film, black hole and white wall, screen and camera. But the same goes for the earlier arts, architecture, painting, even the novel: close-ups animate and invent all of their correlations. So, is your mother a landscape or a face? A face or a factory?

What face has not called upon the landscapes it amalgamated, sea and hill; what landscape has not evoked the face that would have completed it, providing an unexpected complement for its lines and traits? Even when painting becomes abstract, all it does is rediscover the black hole and white wall, the great composition of the white canvas and black slash. Tearing, but also stretching of the canvas along an axis of escape *(fuite), *at a vanishing point  *(point defuite), *along a diagonal, by a knife slice, slash, or hole: the machine is already in place that always functions to produce faces and landscapes, however abstract. Titian began his paintings in black and white, not to make outlines to fill in, but as the matrix for each of the colors to come. The novel—*A flock of geese flew which the snow had dazzled. [Perceval] * *saw them and heard them, for they were going away noisily because of a fal-  con which came drawing after them at a great rate until he found abandoned  one separated from the flock, and he struck it so and bruised it that he  knockedit down to earth.... When Perceval saw the trampled snow on which  the goose had lain, and the blood which appeared around, he leaned upon his  lance and looked at that image, for the blood and the snow together seemed  to him like the fresh color which was on the face of his friend, and he thinks  until he forgets himself; for the vermilion seated on white was on her face just  the same as these three drops of blood on the white snow.... We have seen a  knight who is dozing on his charger. *Everything is there: the redundancy specific to the face and landscape, the snowy white wall of the landscape-face, the black hole of the falcon and the three drops distributed on the wall; and, simultaneously, the silvery line of the landscape-face spinning toward the black hole of the knight deep in catatonia. Cannot the knight, at certain times and under certain conditions, push the movement further still, crossing the black hole, breaking through the white wall, dismantling the face— even if the attempt may backfire? 8 All of this is in no way characteristic of the genre of the novel only at the end of its history; it is there from the beginning, it is an essential part of the genre. It is false to see Don Quixote as the end of the chivalric novel, invoking the hero's hallucinations, harebrained ideas, and hypnotic or cataleptic states. It is false to see novels such as Beckett's as the end of the novel in general, invoking the black holes, the characters' line of deterritorialization, the schizophrenic promenades of Molloy or the Unnameable, their loss of their names, memory, or purpose. The novel does have an evolution, but that is surely not it. The novel has always been defined by the adventure of lost characters who no longer know their name, what they are looking for, or what they are doing, amnesiacs, ataxics, catatonics. They differentiate the genre of the novel from the genres of epic or drama (when the dramatic or epic hero is stricken with folly or forgetting, etc., it is in an entirely different way). *La princesse de*

174 D YEAR ZERO: FACIALITY *Cleves *is a novel precisely by virtue of what seemed paradoxical to the peo ple of the time: the states of absence or "rest," the sleep that overtakes the characters. There is always a Christian education in the novel. Molloy is the beginning of the genre of the novel. When the novel began, with Chretien de Troyes, for example, the essential character that would accompany it over the entire course of its history was already there: The knight of the novel of courtly love spends his time forgetting his name, what he is doing, what people say to him, he doesn't know where he is going or to whom he is speaking, he is continually drawing a line of absolute deterritorialization, but also losing his way, stopping, and falling into black holes. "He awaits chivalry and adventure." Open Chretien de Troyes to any page and you will find a catatonic knight seated on his steed, leaning on his lance, waiting, seeing the face of his loved one in the landscape; you have to hit him to make him respond. Lancelot, in the presence of the queen's white face, doesn't notice his horse plunge into the river; or he gets into a passing cart and it turns out to be the cart of disgrace. There is a face-landscape aggre gate proper to the novel, in which black holes sometimes distribute them selves on a white wall, and the white line of the horizon sometimes spins toward a black hole, or both simultaneously. **Theorems of Deterritorialization, or ** **Machinic Propositions** **9** *First theorem: *One never deterritorializes alone; there are always at least two terms, hand-use object, mouth-breast, face-landscape. And each of the two terms reterritorializes on the other. Reterritorialization must not be confused with a return to a primitive or older territoriality: it necessarily implies a set of artifices by which one element, itself deterritorialized, serves as a new territoriality for another, which has lost its territoriality as well. Thus there is an entire system of horizontal and complementary reter-ritorializations, between hand and tool, mouth and breast, face and landscape. *Second theorem: *The fastest of two elements or movements of deterritorialization is not necessarily the most intense or most deterri torialized. Intensity of deterritorialization must not be confused with speed of movement or development. The fastest can even connect its inten sity to the slowest, which, as an intensity, does not come after the fastest but is simultaneously at work on a different stratum or plane (for example, the way the breast-mouth relation is guided from the start by a plane of faciality). *Third theorem: *It can even be concluded from this that the *least * deterritorialized reterritorializes on the *most *deterritorialized. This is where the second system of reterritorializations comes in, the vertical system running from bottom to top. This is the sense in which not only

As a general rule, relative deterritorializations (transcoding) reterritorialize on a deterritorialization that is in certain respects absolute (overcoding). We have seen that the deterritorialization of the head into a face is absolute but remains negative in that it passes from one stratum to another, from the stratum of the organism to those of signifiance and subjectification. The hand and breast reterritorialize on the face and in the landscape: they are facialized at the same time as they are landscapified. Even a use-object may come to be facialized: you might say that a house, utensil, or object, an article of clothing, etc., is *watching me, *not because it resembles a face, but because it is taken up in the white wall/black hole process, because it connects to the abstract machine of facialization. The close-up in film pertains as much to a knife, cup, clock, or kettle as to a face or facial element, for example, Griffith's "the kettle is watching me." Is it not fair to say, then, that there are close-ups in novels, as when Dickens writes the opening line of *The Cricket on the Hearth: *"The kettle began it. . .", 10 and in painting, when a utensil becomes a face-landscape from within, or when a cup on a tablecloth or a teapot is facialized, in Bonnard, Vuillard? *Fourth theorem: *The abstract machine is therefore effectuated not only in the faces that produce it but also to varying degrees in body parts, clothes, and objects that it facializes following an order of reasons (rather than an organization of resemblances). Yet the question remains: When does the abstract machine of faciality enter into play? When is it triggered? Take some simple examples: the maternal power operating through the face during nursing; the passional power operating through the face of the loved one, even in caresses; the political power operating through the face of the leader (streamers, icons, and photographs), even in mass actions; the power of film operating through the face of the star and the close-up; the power of television. It is not the individuality of the face that counts but the efficacy of the cipher ing it makes possible, and in what cases it makes it possible. This is an affair not of ideology but of economy and the organization of power *(pouvoir). * We are certainly not saying that the face, the power of the face *(la puissance  du visage), *engenders and explains social power *(pouvoir). Certain assem-  blages of power (pouvoir) require the production of a face, *others do not. If we consider primitive societies, we see that there is very little that operates through the face: their semiotic is nonsignifying, nonsubjective, essentially collective, polyvocal, and corporeal, playing on very diverse forms and substances. This polyvocality operates through bodies, their volumes, their internal cavities, their variable exterior connections and coordinates (territorialities). A fragment from a manual semiotic, a manual sequence, may be coordinated, without subordination or unification, with an oral

"The same goes for incest. There is no incest prohibition; instead, there are sequences of incest that connect with sequences of prohibition following specific coordinates. Paintings, tattoos, or marks on the skin embrace the multidi-mensionality of bodies. Even masks ensure the head's belonging to the body, rather than making it a face. Doubtless, there are profound movements of deterritorialization that shake up the coordinates of the body and outline particular assemblages of power; however, they connect the body not to faciality but to becomings-animal, in particular with the help of drugs. Of course, there is no less spirituality for that, for these becomings-animal involve an animal Spirit—a jaguar-spirit, bird-spirit, ocelot-spirit, toucan-spirit—that takes possession of the body's interior, enters its cavities, and fills its volumes instead of making a face for it. Possession expresses a direct relation between Voices and the body rather than a relation to the face. Shaman, warrior, and hunter organizations of power, fragile and precarious, are all the more spiritual by virtue of the fact that they operate through corporeality, animality, and vegetality. When we said earlier that the human head still belongs to the stratum of the organism, we obviously were not denying the existence of culture and society among these peoples; we were merely saying that these cultures' and societies' codes pertain to bodies, to the belonging of heads to bodies, to the ability of the body-head system to *become *and receive souls, and to receive them as friends while repulsing enemy souls. "Primitives" may have the most human of heads, the most beautiful and most spiritual, but they have no face and need none. The reason is simple. The face is not a universal. It is not even that of the white man; it is White Man himself, with his broad white cheeks and the black hole of his eyes. The face is Christ. The face is the typical European, what Ezra Pound called the average sensual man, in short, the ordinary everyday Erotomaniac (nineteenth-century psychiatrists were right to say that erotomania, unlike nymphomania, often remains pure and chaste; this is because it operates through the face and facialization). Not a univer sal, but *fades totius universi. *Jesus Christ superstar: he invented the facialization of the entire body and spread it everywhere (the Passion of Joan of Arc, in close-up). Thus the face is by nature an entirely specific idea, which did not preclude its acquiring and exercising the most general of functions: the function of biuni vocalization, or binarization.

0 YEAR ZERO: FACIALITY D 177 black hole/white wall system, functions in two ways, one of which concerns the units or elements, the other the choices. Under the first aspect, the black hole acts as a central computer, Christ, the third eye that moves across the wall or the white screen serving as general surface of reference. Regardless of the content one gives it, the machine constitutes a facial unit, an elementary face in biunivocal relation with another: it is a man *or *a woman, a rich person or a poor one, an adult or a child, a leader or a subject, "an x *or *a y." The movement of the black hole across the screen, the trajec tory of the third eye over the surface of reference, constitutes so many dichotomies or arborescences, like four-eye machines made of elementary faces linked together two by two. The face of a teacher and a student, father and son, worker and boss, cop and citizen, accused and judge ("the judge had a stern expression, his eyes were horizonless..."): concrete individu alized faces are produced and transformed on the basis of these units, these combinations of units—like the face of a rich child in which a military call ing is already discernible, that West Point chin. You don't so much have a face as slide into one. Under the second aspect, the abstract machine of faciality assumes a role of selective response, or choice: given a concrete face, the machine judges whether it passes or not, whether it goes or not, on the basis of the elementary facial units. This time, the binary relation is of the "yes-no" type. The empty eye or black hole absorbs or rejects, like a half-doddering despot who can still give a signal of acquiescence or refusal. The face of a given teacher is contorted by tics and bathed in an anxiety that makes it "no go." A defendant, a subject, displays an overaffected submission that turns into insolence. Or someone is too polite to be honest. A given face is neither a man's nor a woman's. Or it is neither a poor person's nor a rich person's. Is it someone who lost his fortune? At every moment, the machine rejects faces that do not conform, or seem suspicious. But only at a given level of choice. For it is necessary to produce successive divergence-types of devi ance for everything that eludes biunivocal relationships, and to establish binary relations between what is accepted on first choice and what is only tolerated on second, third choice, etc. The white wall is always expanding, and the black hole functions repeatedly. The teacher has gone mad, but madness is a face conforming to the «th choice (not the last, however, since there are mad faces that do not conform to what one assumes madness should be). A ha! It's not a man and it's not a woman, so it must be a trans-vestite: The binary relation is between the "no" of the first category and the "yes" of the following category, which under certain conditions may just as easily mark a tolerance as indicate an enemy to be mowed down at all costs. At any rate, you've been recognized, the abstract machine has you inscribed in its overall grid. It is clear that in its new role as deviance

**□ II ►** 178 □ YEAR ZERO: FACIALITY detector, the faciality machine does not restrict itself to individual cases  but operates in just as general a fashion as it did in its first role, the compu-  tation of normalities. If the face is in fact Christ, in other words, your aver-  age ordinary White Man, then the first deviances, the first  divergence-types, are racial: yellow man, black man, men in the second  or third category. They are also inscribed on the wall, distributed by the  hole. They must be Christianized, in other words, facialized. European  racism as the white man's claim has never operated by exclusion, or by  the designation of someone as Other: it is instead in primitive societies  that the stranger is grasped as an "other." 12 Racism operates by the determination of degrees of deviance in relation to the White-Man face,  which endeavors to integrate nonconforming traits into increasingly  eccentric and backward waves, sometimes tolerating them at given places  under given conditions, in a given ghetto, sometimes erasing them from  the wall, which never abides alterity (it's a Jew, it's an Arab, it's a Negro,  it's a lunatic . . .). From the viewpoint of racism, there is no exterior, there  are no people on the outside. There are only people who should be like us  and whose crime it is not to be. The dividing line is not between inside  and outside but rather is internal to simultaneous signifying chains and  successive subjective choices. Racism never detects the particles of the  other; it propagates waves of sameness until those who resist  identification have been wiped out (or those who only allow themselves to  be identified at a given degree of divergence). Its cruelty is equaled only by  its incompetence and naivete. On the brighter side, painting has exploited all the resources of the Christ-face. Painting has taken the abstract white wall/black hole machine  of faciality in all directions, using the face of Christ to produce every kind  of facial unit and every degree of deviance. In this respect, there is an  exultation in the painting of the Middle Ages to the Renaissance, like an  unbridled freedom. Not only did Christ preside over the facialization of  the entire body (his own) and the landscapification of all milieus (his own),  but he composed all of the elementary faces and had every divergence at his  disposal: Christ-athlete at the fair, Christ-Mannerist queer, Christ-Negro,  or at least a Black Virgin at the edge of the wall. The most prodigious  strokes of madness appear on canvas under the auspices of the Catholic  code. A single example chosen from many [Giotto, *The Life of St. Francis,  *scene XII, *The Transfiguration*—Trans.]: against the white background of  the landscape and the black-blue hole of the sky, the crucified  Christ-turned-kite-machine sends stigmata to Saint Francis by rays; the  stigmata effect the facialization of the body of the saint, in the image of the  body of Christ; but the rays carrying the stigmata to the saint are also the  strings Francis uses to pull the divine kite. It was under the sign of the  cross

0 YEAR ZERO: FACIALITY □ 179 that people learned to steer the face and processes of facialization in all directions. Information theory takes as its point of departure a homogeneous set of ready-made *signifying *messages that are already functioning as elements in biunivocal relationships, or the elements of which are biunivocally organized between messages. Second, the picking of a combination depends on a certain number *of subjective *binary choices that increase pro portionally to the number of elements. But the problem is that all of this biunivocalization and binarization (which is not just the result of an increase in calculating skills, as some say) assumes the deployment of a wall or screen, the installation of a central computing hole without which no message would be discernible and no choice could be implemented. The black hole/white wall system must already have gridded all of space and outlined its arborescences or dichotomies for those of signifier and subjectification even to be conceivable. The mixed semiotic of signifiance and subjectification has an exceptional need to be protected from any intrusion from the outside. In fact, there must not be any exterior: no nomad machine, no primitive poly vocality must spring up, with their com binations of heterogeneous substances of expression. Translatability of any kind requires a single substance of expression. One can constitute sig nifying chains operating with deterritorialized, digitalized, discrete ele ments only if there is a semiological screen available, a wall to protect them. One can make subjective choices between two chains or at each point in a chain only if no outside tempest sweeps away the chains and subjects. One can form a web of subjectivities only if one possesses a central eye, a black hole capturing everything that would exceed or transform either the assigned affects or the dominant significations. Moreover, it is absurd to believe that language as such can convey a message. A language is always embedded in the faces that announce its statements and ballast them in relation to the signifiers in progress and subjects concerned. Choices are guided by faces, elements are organized around faces: a common grammar is never separable from a facial education. The face is a veritable mega phone. Thus not only must the abstract machine of faciality provide a pro tective screen and a computing black hole; in addition, the faces it produces draw all kinds of arborescences and dichotomies without which the signifying and the subjective would not be able to make the arbor escences and dichotomies function that fall within their purview in lan guage. Doubtless, the binarities and biunivocalities of the face are not the same as those of language, of its elements and subjects. There is no resem blance between them. But the former subtend the latter. When the faciality machine translates formed contents of whatever kind into a single sub stance of expression, it already subjugates them to the exclusive form of

0 180 D YEAR ZERO: FACIALITY signifying and subjective expression. It carries out the prior gridding that makes it possible for the signifying elements to become discernible, and for the subjective choices to be implemented. The faciality machine is not an annex to the signifier and the subject; rather, it is subjacent *(connexe) *to them and is their condition of possibility. Facial biunivocalities and bina-rities double the others; facial redundancies are in redundancy with signifying and subjective redundancies. It is precisely because the face depends on an abstract machine that it does not assume a preexistent subject or signifier; but it is subjacent to them and provides the substance necessary to them. What chooses the faces is not a subject, as in the Szondi test; it is faces that choose their subjects. What interprets the black blotch/white hole figure, or the white page/black hole, is not a signifier, as in the Rorschach test; it is that figure which programs the signifiers. We have made some progress toward answering the question of what triggers the abstract machine of faciality, for it is not in operation all the time or in just any social formation. *Certain *social formations need face, and also landscape. 13 There is a whole history behind it. At very different dates, there occurred a generalized collapse of all of the heterogeneous, polyvocal, primitive semiotics in favor of a semiotic of signifiance and subjectification. Whatever the differences between signifiance and subjec-tification, whichever prevails over the other in this case or that, whatever the varying figures assumed by their de facto mixtures—they have it in common to crush all polyvocality, set up language as a form of exclusive expression, and operate by signifying biunivocalization and subjective binarization. The superlinearity proper to language is no longer coordinated with multidimensional figures: it now flattens out all volumes and subordinates all lines. Is it by chance that linguistics always, and very quickly, encounters the problem of homonymy, or ambiguous statements that it then subjects to a set of binary reductions? More generally, linguistics can tolerate no poly vocality or rhizome traits: a child who runs around, plays, dances, and draws cannot concentrate attention on language and writing, and will never be a good subject. In short, the new semiotic needs systematically to destroy the whole range of primitive semiotic systems, even if it retains some of their debris in well-defined enclosures. However, there is more to the picture than semiotic systems waging war on one another armed only with their own weapons. *Very specific assem-  blages of power impose signifiance and subjectification *as their determinate form of expression, in reciprocal presupposition with new contents: there is no signifiance without a despotic assemblage, no subjectification with out an authoritarian assemblage, and no mixture between the two without assemblages of power that act through signifiers and act upon souls and subjects. It is these assemblages, these despotic or authoritarian forma

A concerted effort is made to do away with the body and corporeal coordinates through which the multidimensional or polyvocal semiotics operated. Bodies are disciplined, corporeality dis mantled, becomings-animal hounded out, deterritorialization pushed to a new threshold—a jump is made from the organic strata to the strata of signifiance and subjectification. A single substance of expression is pro duced. The white wall/black hole system is constructed, or rather the abstract machine is triggered that must allow and ensure the almightiness of the signifier as well as the autonomy of the subject. You will be pinned to the white wall and stuffed in the black hole. This machine is called the faciality machine because it is the social production of face, because it per forms the facialization of the entire body and all its surroundings and objects, and the landscapification of all worlds and milieus. The deter ritorialization of the body implies a reterritorialization on the face; the decoding of the body implies an overcoding by the face; the collapse of cor poreal coordinates or milieus implies the constitution of a landscape. The semiotic of the signifier and the subjective never operates through bodies. It is absurd to claim to relate the signifier to the body. At any rate it can be related only to a body that has already been entirely facialized. The differ ence between our uniforms and clothes and primitive paintings and garb is that the former effect a facialization of the body, with buttons for black holes against the white wall of the material. Even the mask assumes a new function here, the exact opposite of its old one. For there is no unitary func tion of the mask, except a negative one (in no case does the mask serve to dissimulate, to hide, even while showing or revealing). Either the mask assures the head's belonging to the body, its becoming-animal, as was the case in primitive societies. Or, as is the case now, the mask assures the erec tion, the construction of the face, the facialization of the head and the body: the mask is now the face itself, the abstraction or operation of the face. The inhumanity of the face. Never does the face assume a prior signifier or subject. The order is totally different: despotic and authoritar ian concrete assemblage of power —► triggering of the abstract machine of faciality, white wall/black hole —&amp;gt; installation of the new semiotic of signifiance and subjectification on that holey surface. That is why we have been addressing just two problems exclusively: the relation of the face to the abstract machine that produces it, and the relation of the face to the assemblages of power that require that social production. The face is a politics. Of course, we have already seen that signifiance and subjectification are semiotic systems that are entirely distinct in their principles and have

0 182 □ YEAR ZERO: FACIALITY different regimes (circular irradiation versus segmentary linearity) and different apparatuses of power (despotic generalized slavery versus author itarian contract-proceeding). Neither begins with Christ, or the White Man as Christian universal: there are Indian, African, and Asiatic despotic formations of signifiance; the authoritarian process of subjectification appears most purely in the destiny of the Jewish people. But however dif ferent these semiotics are, they still form a de facto *mix, *and it is at the level of this mixture that they assert their imperialism, in other words, their common endeavor to crush all other semiotics. There is no signifiance that does not harbor the seeds of subjectivity; there is no subjectification that does not drag with it remnants of signifier. If the signifier bounces above all off a wall, if subjectivity spins above all toward a hole, then we must say that the wall of the signifier already includes holes and the black hole of subjec tivity already carries scraps of wall. The mix, therefore, has a solid founda tion in the indissociable white wall/black hole machine, and the two semiotics intermingle through intersection, splicing, and the plugging of one into the other, as with the "Hebrew and the Pharaoh." But there is more because the nature of the mixtures may vary greatly. If it is possible to assign the faciality machine a date—the year zero of Christ and the histori cal development of the White Man—it is because that is when the mixture ceased to be a splicing or an intertwining, becoming a total interpene-tration in which each element suffuses the other like drops of red-black wine in white water. Our semiotic of modern White Men, the semiotic of capitalism, has attained this state of mixture in which signifiance and subjectification effectively interpenetrate. Thus it is in this semiotic that faciality, or the white wall/black hole system, assumes its full scope. We must, however, assess the states of mixture and the varying proportions of the elements. Whether in the Christian or pre-Christian state, one element may dominate another, one may be more or less powerful than the other. We are thus led to define *limit-faces, * which are different from both the facial units and the degrees of facial divergence previously defined. 1\. The black hole is on the white wall. It is not a unit, since the black hole is in constant movement on the wall and operates by binarization. Two black holes, four black holes, *n *black holes distribute themselves like eyes. Faciality is always a multiplicity. The landscape will be populated with eyes or black holes, as in an Ernst painting, or a drawing by Aloi'se or Wolfli. Cir cles are drawn around a hole on the white wall; an eye can be placed in each of the circles. We can even propose the following law: the more circles there are around a hole, the more the bordering effect acts to increase the surface over which the hole slides and to give that surface a force of capture. Per haps the purest case is to be found in popular Ethiopian scrolls represent ing demons: on the white surface of the parchment, two black holes are

This is the signifying despotic face and the multiplication proper to it, its proliferation, its redundancy of frequency. A multiplication of eyes. The despot or his representatives are everywhere.

0 184 □ YEAR ZERO: FACIALITY whose far end coils around the hole. It is still a multiplicity but constitutes a different figure of destiny: reflexive, passional, subjective destiny. It is the  *maritime *face or landscape: it follows the line separating the sky from the waters, or the land from the waters. This authoritarian face is in profile and spins toward the black hole. Or else there are two faces facing each other, but in profile to the observer, and their union is already marked by a limit less separation. Or else the faces turn away from each other, swept away by betrayal. Tristan, Isolde, Isolde, Tristan, in the boat carrying them to the black hole of betrayal and death. A faciality of consciousness and passion, a redundancy of resonance and coupling. This time, the effect of the close-up is no longer to expand a surface while simultaneously closing it off; its only function is to have an anticipatory temporal value. It marks the origin of a scale of intensity, or is part of that scale; the closer the faces get to the black hole as termination point, the more the close-up heats the line they follow. Eisenstein's close-ups versus Griffith's (the intensive heightening of shame, or anger, in the close-ups in *Potemkin).* *15* * *Here again, it is clear that any combination is possible between the two limit-figures of the face. In Pabst's *Lulu, *the despotic face of the fallen Lulu is associated with the image of a bread knife, which has the anticipatory value of foreshadowing the murder; but the authoritarian face of Jack the Ripper also ascends a whole scale of intensities leading to the knife and Lulu's murder. More generally, we may note characteristics common to the two limit-figures. First, although the white wall, the broad cheeks, is the substantial element of the signifier, and the black hole the reflexive element of subjectivity, they always go together. But in one of two modes: either the black holes distribute themselves and multiply on the white wall, or the wall, reduced to its crest or horizon thread, hurtles toward a black hole that crests them all. There is no wall without black holes, and no black hole without a wall. Second, in both cases the black hole is necessarily surrounded by a border, or even bordered more than once: the effect of this border is either to expand the surface of the wall or to intensify the line. The black hole is never in the eyes (pupil); it is always inside the border, and the eyes are always inside the hole: dead eyes, which see all the better for being in a black hole. 16 These common characteristics do not preclude the existence of a limit-difference between the two figures of the face, and proportions according to which first one then the other dominates in the mixed semiotic. The terrestrial signifying despotic face, the maritime subjective passional authoritarian face (the desert can also be a sea of land). Two figures of destiny, two states of the faciality machine. Jean Paris has clearly shown how these poles operate in painting, the pole of the despotic Christ and that of the passional Christ: on the one hand, the face of Christ seen from the front, as in a Byzantine mosaic, with the black hole of the eyes

0 186 □ YEAR ZERO: FACIALITY fragment of a painting. A piece of music must let fall a little phrase that connects with Odette's face, to the point that the little phrase becomes only a signal. The white wall becomes populous, the black holes are arrayed. This entire mechanism of signifiance, with its referral of interpretations, prepares the way for the second, passional subjective, moment, during which Swann's jealousy, querulous delusion, and erotomania develop. Now Odette's face races down a line hurtling toward a single black hole, that of Swann's Passion. The other lines, of landscapity, picturality, and musicality, also rush toward this catatonic hole and coil around it, border ing it several times. But in the third moment, at the end of his long passion, Swann attends a reception where he sees the faces of the servants and guests *disaggregate * into autonomous aesthetic traits, as if the line of picturality regained its independence, both beyond the wall and outside the black hole. Then Vinteuil's little phrase regains its transcendence and renews its connection with a still more intense, asignifying, and asubjective line of pure musi cality. And Swann knows that he no longer loves Odette and, above all, that Odette will never again love him. Was this salvation through art necessary? For neither Swann nor Proust was saved. Was it necessary to break through the wall and out of the hole in  *this *way, by renouncing love? Was not that love rotten from the start, made of signifiance and jealousy? Was it possible to do anything else, considering Odette's mediocrity and Swann's aestheticism? In a way, the madeleine is the same story. The narrator munches his madeleine: redundancy, the black hole of involuntary memory. How can he get out of that? And it is, above all, something one has to get out of, escape from. Proust knows that quite well, even if his commentators do not. But the way he gets out is through art, uniquely through art. How do you get out of the black hole? How do you break through the wall? How do you dismantle the face? Whatever genius there may be in the French novel, that is not its affair. It is too concerned with measuring the wall, or even with building it, with plumbing the depths of black holes and composing faces. The French novel is profoundly pessimistic and idealis tic, "critical of life rather than creative of life." It stuffs its characters down the hole and bounces them off the wall. It can only conceive of organized voyages, and of salvation only through art, a still Catholic salvation, in other words, salvation through eternity. It spends its time plotting points instead of drawing lines, active lines of flight or of positive deterritori-alization. The Anglo-American novel is totally different. "To get away. To get away, out!... To cross a horizon .. ." 18 From Hardy to Lawrence, from Melville to Miller, the same cry rings out: Go across, get out, break through, make a beeline, don't get stuck on a point.

That is why their relationship to other civilizations, to the Orient or South America, and also to drugs and voyages in place, is entirely different from that of the French. They know how difficult it is to get out of the black hole of subjectivity, of conscious ness and memory, of the couple and conjugality. How tempting it is to let yourself get caught, to lull yourself into it, to latch back onto *aface. *"[Being] locked away in the black hole. . . gave her a molten copperish glow, the words coming out of her mouth like lava, her flesh clutching ravenously for a hold, a perch on something solid and substantial, something in which to reintegrate and repose for a few moments. ... At first I mistook it for pas sion, for ecstasy. ... I thought I had found a living volcano, a female Vesuvius. I never thought I had found a human ship going down in an ocean of despair, in a Sargasso of impotence. Now I think of that black star gleaming through the hole in the ceiling, that fixed star which hung above our conjugal cell, more fixed, more remote than the Absolute, and I know it was her, emptied of all that was properly herself: a dead black sun without aspect." 19 A copperish glow like the face at the bottom of a black hole. The point is to get out of it, not in art, in other words, in spirit, but in life, in real life. *Don't take away my power to love. *These English and American authors also know how hard it is to break through the wall of the signifier. Many people have tried since Christ, beginning with Christ. But Christ himself botched the crossing, the jump, he *bounced *off the wall. "As if by a great recoil, this negative backwash rolled up and stayed his death. The whole negative impulse of humanity seemed to coil up into a monstrous inert mass to create the human integer, the figure one, one and indivisible"—the Face. 20 Cross the wall, the Chinese perhaps, but at what price? At the price of a *becoming-animal, *a *becoming-flower or rock, *and beyond that a strange  *becoming-imperceptible, *a *becoming-hard now one with loving.* *11* * *It is a question of speed, even if the movement is in place. Is this also to dismantle the face, or as Miller says, no longer to look at or into the eyes but to swim through them, to close your own eyes and make your body a beam of light moving at ever-increasing speed? Of course, this requires all the resources of art, and art of the highest kind. It requires a whole line of writing, picturality, musicality... For it is through writing that you become animal, it is through color that you become imperceptible, it is through music that you become hard and memoryless, simultaneously animal and impercepti ble: in love. But art is never an end in itself; it is only a tool for blazing life lines, in other words, all of those real becomings that are not produced only  *in *art, and all of those active escapes that do not consist in fleeing *into *art, taking refuge in art, and all of those positive deterritorializations that never reterritorialize on art, but instead sweep it away with them toward the realms of the asignifying, asubjective, and faceless.

0 188 □ YEAR ZERO: FACIALITY Dismantling the face is no mean affair. Madness is a definite danger: Is it by chance that schizos lose their sense of the face, their own and others', their sense of the landscape, and the sense of language and its dominant sig nifications all at the same time? The organization of the face is a strong one. We could say that the face holds within its rectangle or circle a whole set of traits, *faciality traits, *which it subsumes and places at the service of signifiance and subjectification. What is a tic? It is precisely the continu ally refought battle between a faciality trait that tries to escape the sover eign organization of the face and the face itself, which clamps back down on the trait, takes hold of it again, blocks its line of flight, and reimposes its organization upon it. (There is a medical distinction between the clonic or convulsive tic and the tonic or spasmodic tic; perhaps we can say that in the first case the faciality trait that is trying to escape has the upper hand, whereas in the second case the facial organization that is trying to clamp back down or immobilize itself has the upper hand.) But if dismantling the face is a major affair, it is because it is not simply a question of tics, or an amateur's or aesthete's adventure. If the face is a politics, dismantling the face is also a politics involving real becomings, an entire becoming-clandestine. Dismantling the face is the same as breaking through the wall of the signifier and getting out of the black hole of subjectivity. Here, the program, the slogan, of schizoanalysis is: Find your black holes and white walls, know them, know your faces; it is the only way you will be able to dismantle them and draw your lines of flight. 22 It is time once again to multiply practical warnings. First, it is never a question of a return to ... It is not a question of "returning" to the presignifying and presubjective semiotics of primitive peoples. We will always be failures at playing African or Indian, even Chinese, and no voy age to the South Seas, however arduous, will allow us to cross the wall, get out of the hole, or lose our face. We will never succeed in making ourselves a new primitive head and body, human, spiritual, and faceless. It would only be taking more photos and bouncing off the wall again. We will always find ourselves reterritorialized again. O my little desert island, on you I am in the Closerie des Lilas again, O my deep ocean, you reflect the lake in the Bois de Boulogne, O little phrase of Vinteuil, you recall a sweet moment. These are Eastern physical and spiritual exercises, but for a couple, like a conjugal bed tucked with a Chinese sheet: you did do your exercises today, didn't you? Lawrence has only one grudge against Melville: he knew better than anyone how to get across the face, the eyes and horizon, the wall and hole, but he mistook that crossing, that creative line, for an "impossible return," a return to the savages in *Typee, *for a way of staying an artist and hating life, of maintaining a nostalgia for the Home Country. ("He ever pined for Home and Mother, the two things he had run away from as far as

But he stuck to his ideal of perfect relationship, pos sible perfect love.... A truly perfect relationship is one in which each party leaves great tracts unknown in the other party.. . . Melville was, at the core, a mystic and an idealist.... And he stuck to his ideal guns. I abandon mine. I say, let the old guns rot. *Get new ones, and shoot straight.")* *23,* We can't turn back. Only neurotics, or, as Lawrence says, "renegades," deceivers, attempt a regression. The white wall of the signifier, the black hole of subjectivity, and the facial machine are impasses, the measure of our submissions and subjections; but we are born into them, and it is there we must stand battle. Not in the sense of a necessary stage, but in the sense of a tool for which a new use must be invented. Only across the wall of the signifier can you run lines of asignifiance that void all memory, all return, all possible signification and interpretation. Only in the black hole of subjective consciousness and passion do you discover the transformed, heated, captured particles you must relaunch for a nonsubjective, living love in which each party connects with unknown tracts in the other without entering or conquering them, in which the lines composed are broken lines. Only on your face and at the bottom of your black hole and upon your white wall will you be able to set faciality traits free like birds, not in order to return to a primitive head, but to invent the combinations by which those traits connect with landscapity traits that have themselves been freed from the landscape and with traits of picturality and musicality that have also been freed from their respective codes. With what joy the painters used the face of Christ himself, taking it in every sense and direction; and it was not simply the joy of a desire to paint, but the joy of all desires. Is it possible to tell, when the knight of the courtly novel is in his catatonic state, whether he is deep in his black hole or already astride the particles that will carry him out of it to begin a new journey? Lawrence, who has been compared to Lancelot, writes: "To be alone, mindless and memoryless beside the sea... As alone and as absent and as present as an aboriginal dark on the sand in the sun ... Far off, far off, as if he had landed on another planet, as a man might after death. . . The landscape?—he cared not a thing about the land scape. . . . Humanity?—there was none. Thought?—fallen like a stone into the sea. The great, the glamorous past?—worn thin, frail, like a frail trans lucent film of shell thrown up on the shore." 24 The uncertain moment at which the white wall/black hole, black point/white shore system, as on a Japanese print, itself becomes one with the act of leaving it, breaking away from and crossing through it. We have seen that the abstract machine has two very different states: sometimes it is taken up in strata where it brings about deterritorial-izations that are merely relative, or deterritorializations that are absolute

0 190 □ YEAR ZERO: FACIALITY but remain negative; sometimes it is developed on a plane of consistency giving it a "diagrammatic" function, a positive value of deterritorial-ization, the ability to form new abstract machines. Sometimes the abstract machine, as the faciality machine, forces flows into signifiances and subjectifications, into knots of aborescence and holes of abolition; sometimes, to the extent that it performs a veritable "defacialization," it frees something like *probe-heads {fetes chercheuses, * guidance devices) that dismantle the strata in their wake, break through the walls of signifiance, pour out of the holes of subjectivity, fell trees in favor of veritable rhizomes, and steer the flows down lines of positive deterritorializaton or creative flight. There are no more concentrically organized strata, no more black holes around which lines coil to form borders, no more walls to which dichotomies, binarities, and bipolar values cling. There is no more face to be in redundancy with a landscape, painting, or little phrase of music, each perpetually bringing the other to mind, on the unified surface of the wall or the central swirl of the black hole. Each freed faciality trait forms a rhizome with a freed trait of landscapity, picturality, or musicality. This is not a collection of part-objects but a living block, a connecting of stems by which the traits of a face enter a real multiplicity or diagram with a trait of an unknown landscape, a trait of painting or music that is thereby effectively produced, created, according to quanta of absolute, positive deterritori-alization—not evoked or recalled according to systems of reterritorializa-tion. A wasp trait and an orchid trait. Quanta marking so many mutations of abstract machines, each of which operates as a function of the other. Thus opens a rhizomatic realm of possibility effecting the potentialization of the possible, as opposed to arborescent possibility, which marks a closure, an impotence. *The face, what a horror. *It is naturally a lunar landscape, with its pores, planes, matts, bright colors, whiteness, and holes: there is no need for a close-up to make it inhuman; it is naturally a close-up, and naturally inhuman, a monstrous hood. Necessarily so because it is produced by a machine and in order to meet the requirements of the special apparatus of power that triggers the machine and takes deterritorialization to the abso lute while keeping it negative. Earlier, when we contrasted the primitive, spiritual, human head with the inhuman face, we were falling victim to a nostalgia for a return or regression. In truth, there are only inhumanities, humans are made exclusively of inhumanities, but very different ones, of very different natures and speeds. Primitive inhumanity, prefacial inhu manity, has all the polyvocality of a semiotic in which the head is a part of the body, a body that is already deterritorialized relatively and plugged into becomings-spiritual/animal. Beyond the face lies an altogether differ ent inhumanity: no longer that of the primitive head, but of "probe-heads";

0 8\.  1874: Three Novellas, or 'What Happened?" It is not very difficult to determine the essence of the "novella" as a literary genre: Everything is organized around the question, "What happened? Whatever could have happened?" The tale is the opposite of the novella, because it is an altogether different question that the reader asks with bated breath: What is going to happen? Something is always going to happen, come to pass. Something always happens in the novel also, but the novel integrates elements of the novella and the tale into the variation of its perpetual living present *(duration). *The detective novel is a particularly hybrid genre in this respect, since most often the something = Xthat has happened is on the order of a murder or theft, but exactly what it is that has happened remains to be discovered, and in the present determined by the model detective. Yet it would be an error to reduce these different aspects to the three dimensions of time. Something happened, something is going to happen, can designate a past so immediate, a future so near, that they are one (as Husserl would say) with retentions and protentions of the present 192

0 1874: THREE NOVELLAS, OR "WHAT HAPPENED?" □ 193 itself. Nevertheless, the distinction is legitimate, in view of the different movements that animate the present, are contemporaneous with it: One moves with it, another already casts it into the past *from the moment *it is present (novella), while another *simultaneously *draws it into the future (tale). We are lucky to have treatments of the same subject by a tale writer and a novella writer: two lovers, one of whom dies suddenly in the other's room. In Maupassant's tale, "Une ruse" (An artifice), everything revolves around these questions: What is going to happen? How will the survivor extricate himself from the situation? What will the third party-savior, in this case a doctor, think of? In Barbey d'Aurevilly's novella, "Le rideau cramoisi" (The crimson curtain), everything revolves around: Something happened, but what? That is the question, not only because it is really not known what the cold young woman just died from, but also because it will never be known why she gave herself to the petty officer, or how the third party-savior, here the colonel of the regiment, was able to arrange things. 1 It should not be thought that it is easier to leave things open-ended: for there to be something that has happened that we will never know about, or even several things in a row, requires no less minute attention and precision than the contrary case, when the author must invent the details of what will need to be known. You will never know what just happened, or you will always know what is going to happen: these are the reasons for the reader's two bated breaths, in the novella and the tale, respectively, and they are two ways in which the living present is divided at every instant. In the novella, we do not wait for something to happen, we expect something to have just happened. The novella is a last novella, whereas the tale is a first tale. The "presence" of the tale writer is completely different from that of the novella writer (and both are different from that of the novelist). Let us not dwell too much on the dimensions of time: the novella has little to do with a memory of the past or an act of reflection; quite to the contrary, it plays upon a fun damental forgetting. It evolves in the element of "what happened" because it places us in a relation with something unknowable and imperceptible (and not the other way around: it is not because it speaks of a past about which it can no longer provide us knowledge). It may even be that nothing has happened, but it is precisely that nothing that makes us say, Whatever could have happened to make me forget where I put my keys, or whether I mailed that letter, etc.? What little blood vessel in my brain could have rup tured? What is this nothing that makes something happen? The novella has a fundamental relation to *secrecy *(not with a secret matter or object to be discovered, but with the form of the secret, which remains impenetrable), whereas the tale has a relation to *discovery *(the form of discovery, indepen dent of what can be discovered). The novella also enacts *postures *of the body and mind that are like folds or envelopments, whereas the tale puts

0 194 □ 1874: THREE NOVELLAS, OR "WHAT HAPPENED?" into play *attitudes or positions *that are like unfoldings and developments, however unexpected. Barbey has an evident fondness for body posture, in other words, states of the body when it is surprised by something that just happened. In the preface to the *Diaboliques, *Barbey even suggests that there is a diabolism of body postures, a sexuality, pornography, and scatol-ogy of postures quite different from those that also, and simultaneously, mark body attitudes or positions. Posture is like inverse suspense. Thus it is not a question of saying that the novella relates to the past and the tale to the future; what we should say instead is that the novella relates, in the present itself, to the formal dimension of something that has happened, even if that something is nothing or remains unknowable. Similarly, one should not try to make the distinction between the novella and the tale coincide with categories such as the fantastic, the fabulous, etc.; that is another problem, there is no reason why it should overlap. The links of the novella are: What happened? (the modality or expression), Secrecy (the form), Body Posture (the content). Take Fitzgerald. He is a tale and novella writer of genius. He is a novella writer when he asks himself, *Whatever could have happened for things to  have come to this? He *is the only one who has been able to carry this ques tion to such a point of intensity. It is not a question of memory, reflection, old age, or fatigue, whereas the tale would deal with childhood, action, or impulse. Yet it is true that Fitzgerald only asks himself the question of the novella writer when he is personally worn-out, fatigued, sick, or even worse off. But once again, there is not necessarily a connection: it can also be a question of vigor, or love. It still is, even in desperate conditions. It is better to think of it as an affair of perception: you enter a room and perceive something as already there, as just having happened, even though it has not yet been done. Or you know that what is in the process of happening is hap pening for the last time, it's already over with. You hear an "I love you" you know is the last one. Perceptual semiotics. God, whatever could have hap pened, even though everything is and remains imperceptible, and in order for everything to be and remain imperceptible forever? Not only is there a specificity of the novella, but there is also a specific way in which the novella treats a universal matter. For we are made of lines. We are not only referring to lines of writing. Lines of writing conjugate with other lines, life lines, lines of luck or misfortune, lines productive of the variation of the line of writing itself, lines that are *between the lines *of writ ing. Perhaps the novella has its own way of giving rise to and combining these lines, which nonetheless belong to everyone and every genre. Vladimir Propp has said, with great solemnity, that the folktale must be defined in terms of external and internal *movements *that it qualifies, for malizes, and combines in its own specific way. 2 We would like to demon

0 1874: THREE NOVELLAS, OR "WHAT HAPPENED?" D 195 strate that the novella is defined by living *lines, *flesh lines, about which it brings a special revelation. Marcel Arland is correct to say that the novella "is nothing but pure lines right down to the nuances, *and *nothing but the pure and conscious power of the word." 3 **First Novella: "In the Cage," Henry James** The heroine, a young telegrapher, leads a very clear-cut, calculated life pro ceeding by delimited segments: the telegrams she takes one after the other, day after day; the people to whom she sends the telegrams; their social class and the different ways they use telegraphy; the words to be counted. More over, her telegraphist's cage is like a contiguous segment to the grocery store next door, where her fiance works. Contiguity of territories. And the fiance is constantly plotting out their future, work, vacations, house. Here, as for all of us, there is a line of rigid segmentarity on which everything seems calculable and foreseen, the beginning and end of a segment, the pas sage from one segment to another. Our lives are made like that: Not only are the great molar aggregates segmented (States, institutions, classes), but so are people as elements of an aggregate, as are feelings as relations between people; they are segmented, not in such a way as to disturb or dis perse, but on the contrary to ensure and control the identity of each agency, including personal identity. The fiance can say to the young woman, Even though there are differences between our segments, we have the same tastes and we are alike. I am a man, you are a woman; you are a telegraphist, I am a grocer; you count words, I weigh things; our segments fit together, conju gate. Conjugality. A whole interplay of well-determined, well-planned ter ritories. They have a future but no becoming. This is the first life line, the  *molar or rigid line of segmentarity; *in no sense is it dead, for it occupies and pervades our life, and always seems to prevail in the end. It even includes much tenderness and love. It would be too easy to say, "This is a bad line," for you find it everywhere, and in all the other lines. A rich couple comes into the post office and reveals to the young woman, or at least confirms, the existence of another life: coded, multiple tele grams, signed with pseudonyms. It is hard to tell who is who anymore, or what anything means. Instead of a rigid line composed of well-determined segments, telegraphy now forms a supple flow marked by *quanta *that are like so many little segmentations-in-progress grasped at the moment of their birth, as on a moonbeam, or on an intensive scale. Thanks to her "pro digious talent for interpretation," the young woman grasps that the man has a secret that has placed him in danger, deeper and deeper in danger, in a dangerous posture. It does not just have to do with his love relations with the woman. James has reached the stage in his work when it is no longer the

Now what counts is the form of the  secret; the matter no longer even has to be discovered (we never find out,  there are several possibilities, there is an objective indetermination, a kind  of molecularization of the secret). In relation to this man, directly with  him, the young telegraphist develops a strange passional complicity, a  whole intense molecular life that does not even enter into rivalry with the  life she leads with her fiance. What has happened, whatever could have  happened? This life, however, is not in her head, it is not imaginary. Rather,  we should say that there are *two politics *involved, as the young woman sug-  gests in a remarkable conversation with her fiance: a macropohtics and a  micropolitics that do not envision classes, sexes, people, or feelings in at all  the same way. Or again, there are two very different types of relations:  intrinsic relations of *couples *involving well-determined aggregates or ele-  ments (social classes, men and women, this or that particular person), and  less localizable relations that are always external to themselves and instead  concern flows and particles eluding those classes, sexes, and persons. Why  are the latter relations *of doubles *rather than of couples? "She was literally  afraid of the alternate self who might be waiting outside. He might be wait-  ing; it was he who was her alternate self, and of him she was afraid." 4 In any case, this line is very different from the previous one; it is a *line of molecu-  lar or supple segmentation *the segments of which are like quanta of  deterritorialization. It is on this line that a present is defined whose very  form is the form of something that has already happened, however close  you might be to it, since the ungraspable matter of that something is  entirely molecularized, traveling at speeds beyond the ordinary thresholds  of perception. Yet we will not say that it is necessarily better. There is no question that the two lines are constantly interfering, react ing upon each other, introducing into each other either a current of supple-  ness or a point of rigidity. Nathalie Sarraute, in her essay on the novel,  praises English novelists, not only for discovering (as did Proust and  Dostoyevsky) the great movements, territories, and points of the uncon-  scious that allow us to regain time or revive the past, but also for  inopportunely following these molecular lines, simultaneously present and  imperceptible. She shows that dialogue or conversation does indeed com-  ply with the breaks of a fixed segmentarity, with vast movements of regu-  lated distribution corresponding to the attitudes and positions of each of  us; but also that they are run through and swept up by *micromovements,  *fine segmentations distributed in an entirely different way, unfindable par-  ticles of an anonymous matter, tiny cracks and postures operating by dif-  ferent agencies even in the unconscious, secret lines of disorientation or

There is a danger that these vibrations traversing us may be aggravated beyond our endurance. What happened? The molecular relation between the telegraphist and the telegraph sender dissolved in the form of the secret—because nothing happened. Each of them is propelled toward a rigid segmentarity: he will marry the now-widowed lady, she will marry her fiance. And yet everything has changed. She has reached something like a new line, a third type, a kind of *line of flight *that is just as real as the others even if it occurs in place: this line no longer tolerates segments; rather, it is like an exploding of the two segmentary series. She has broken through the wall, she has gotten out of the black holes. She has attained a kind of absolute deterritorialization. "She ended up knowing so much that she could no longer interpret any thing. *There were no longer shadows to help her see more clearly, only  glare."* *6* * *You cannot go further in life than this sentence by James. The nature of the secret has changed once again. Undoubtedly, the secret always has to do with love, and sexuality. But previously it was either only a hidden matter given in the past (the better hidden the more ordinary it was), and we did not exactly know what form to give it: See, I am bending under the burden of my secret, see what mystery resides within me. It was a way of seeming interesting, what D. H. Lawrence called "the dirty little secret," *my *Oedipus, in a way. Or else the secret became the form of some thing whose matter was molecularized, imperceptible, unassignable: not a given of the past but the ungivable "What happened?" But on this third line there is no longer even any form—nothing but a pure abstract line. It is because we no longer have anything to hide that we can no longer be appre hended. To become imperceptible oneself, to have dismantled love in order to become capable of loving. To have dismantled one's self in order finally to be alone and meet the true double at the other end of the line. A clandestine passenger on a motionless voyage. To become like everybody else; but this, precisely, is a becoming only for one who knows how to be nobody, to no longer be anybody. To paint oneself gray on gray. As Kierkegaard says, nothing distinguishes the knight of the faith from a bour geois German going home or to the post office: he sends off no special tele graphic sign; he constantly produces or reproduces finite segments, yet he is already moving on a line no one even suspects. 7 In any case, the tele graphic line is not a symbol, and it is not simple. There are at least three of them: a line of rigid and clear-cut segmentarity; a line of molecular segmentarity; and an abstract line, a line of flight no less deadly and no less

On the first line, there are many words and conversa tions, questions and answers, interminable explanations, precisions; the second is made of silences, allusions, and hasty innuendos inviting interpretation. But if the third line flashes, if the line of flight is like a train in motion, it is because one jumps linearly on it, one can finally speak "literally" of anything at all, a blade of grass, a catastrophe or sensation, calmly accepting that which occurs when it is no longer possible for any thing to stand for anything else. The three lines, however, continually intermingle. **Second Novella: "The ** **Crack-up," F. Scott Fitzgerald** What happened? This is the question Fitzgerald keeps coming back to toward the end, having remarked that "of course all life is a process of breaking down." 8 How should we understand this "of course"? We can say, first of all, that life is always drawn into an increasingly rigid and desic cated segmentarity. For the writer Fitzgerald, voyages, with their clear-cut segments, had lost their usefulness. There was also, from segment to seg ment, the depression, loss of wealth, fatigue and growing old, alcoholism, the failure of conjugality, the rise of the cinema, the advent of fascism and Stalinism, and the loss of success and talent—at the very moment Fitzgerald would find his genius. " *The big sudden blows that come, or seem  to come, from outside" *(p. 69), and proceed by oversignificant *breaks, *mov ing us from one term to the other according to successive binary "choices": rich/poor... Even when change runs in the other direction, there is nothing to compensate for the rigidification, the aging that overcodes everything that occurs. This is a line of rigid segmentarity bringing masses into play, even if it was supple to begin with. But Fitzgerald says that there is another type of cracking, with an en tirely different segmentarity. Instead of great breaks, these are micro-cracks, as in a dish; they are much more subtle and supple, and *occur  when things are going well on the other side. *If there is aging on this line, it is not of the same kind: when you age on this line you don't feel it on the other line, you don't notice it on the other line until after "it" has already happened on this line. At such a moment, which does not correspond to any of the ages of the other line, you reach a degree, a quantum, an intensity beyond which you cannot go. (It's a very delicate business, these intensities: the finest intensity becomes harmful if it overtaxes your strength at a given moment; you have to be able to take it, you have to be in shape.) But what exactly happened? In truth, nothing assignable or perceptible: molecular changes, redistributions of desire such that when something occurs, the self that

This time, there are outbursts and crackings in the immanence of a rhi zome, rather than great movements and breaks determined by the tran scendence of a tree. The crack-up "happens almost without your knowing it but is realized suddenly indeed" (p. 69). This molecular line, more supple but no less disquieting, in fact, much more disquieting, is not simply inter nal or personal: it also brings everything into play, but on a different scale and in different forms, with segmentations of a different nature, rhizomatic instead of arborescent. A micropolitics. There is, in addition, a third line, which is like a line of rupture or a "clean break" and marks the exploding of the other two, their shake-up... in favor of something else? "This led me to the idea that the ones who had survived had made some sort of clean break. This is a big word and is no parallel to a jailbreak when one is probably headed for a new jail or will be forced back to the old one" (p. 81). Here, Fitzgerald contrasts rupture with structural pseudobreaks in so-called signifying chains. But he also distin guishes it from more supple, more subterranean links or stems of the "voy age" type, or even from molecular conveyances. "The famous 'Escape' or 'run away from it all' is an excursion in a trap even if the trap includes the South Seas, which are only for those who want to paint them or sail them. A clean break is something you cannot come back from; that is irretrievable because it makes the past cease to exist" (p. 81). Can it be that voyages are always a return to rigid segmentarity? Is it always your daddy and mommy that you meet when you travel, even as far away as the South Seas, like Melville? Hardened muscles? Must we say that supple segmentarity itself reconstructs the great figures it claimed to escape, but under the micro scope, in miniature? Beckett's unforgettable line is an indictment of all voyages: " *We don't travel for the fun of it, as far as I know; we're foolish, but  not that foolish."* In rupture, not only has the matter of the past volitized; the form of what happened, of an imperceptible something that happened in a volatile mat ter, no longer even exists. One has become imperceptible and clandestine in motionless voyage. Nothing can happen, or can have happened, any longer. Nobody can do anything for or against me any longer. My territories are out of grasp, not because they are imaginary, but the opposite: because I am in the process of drawing them. Wars, big and little, are behind me. Voy ages, always in tow to something else, are behind me. I no longer have any secrets, having lost my face, form, and matter. I am now no more than a line. I have become capable of loving, not with an abstract, universal love, but a love I shall choose, and that shall choose me, blindly, my double, just as selfless as I. One has been saved by and for love, by abandoning love and self. Now one is no more than an abstract line, like an arrow crossing the

One has become like everybody/the whole world *(tout le monde), *but in a way that can become like everybody/ the whole world. One has painted the world on oneself, not oneself on the world. It should not be said that the genius is an extraordinary person, *nor * that everybody has genius. The genius is someone who knows how to make everybody/the whole world a becoming (Ulysses, perhaps: Joyce's failed ambition, Pound's near-success). One has entered becomings-animal, becomings-molecular, and finally becomings-imperceptible. "I was off the dispensing end of the relief roll forever. The heady villainous feeling con tinued. ... I will try to be a correct animal though, and if you throw me a bone with enough meat on it I may even lick your hand." 9 Why such a despairing tone? Does not the line of rupture or true flight have its own danger, one worse than the others? Time to die. In any case, Fitzgerald pro poses a distinction between the three lines traversing us and composing "a life" (after Maupassant). *Break line, crack line, rupture line. *The line of rigid segmentarity with molar breaks; the line of supple segmentation with molecular cracks; the line of flight or rupture, abstract, deadly and alive, nonsegmentary. **Third Novella: "The Story of the ** **Abyss and the Spyglass," Pierrette Fleutiaux** **10** Some segments are more or less near, and others more or less distant. The segments seem to encircle an abyss, a kind of huge black hole. On each seg ment there are two kinds of lookouts, near-seers and far-seers. What they watch for are the movements, outbursts, infractions, disturbances, and rebellions occurring in the abyss. But there is a major difference between the two types of lookouts. The near-seers have a simple spyglass. In the abyss, they see the outline of gigantic cells, great binary divisions, dichoto mies, well-defined segments of the type "classroom, barracks, low-income housing project, or even countryside seen from an airplane." They see branches, chains, rows, columns, dominoes, striae. Once in a while along the edges they discover a misshapen figure or a shaky contour. Then they bring out the terrible Ray Telescope. It is used not to see with but to cut with, to cut out shapes. This geometrical instrument, which emits a laser beam, assures the dominion of the great signifying break everywhere and restores the momentarily threatened molar order. The cutting telescope  *overcodes *everything; it acts on flesh and blood, but itself is nothing but pure geometry, as a State affair, and the near-seers' physics in the service of that machine. What is geometry, what is the State, and what are the near-seers? These are meaningless questions ("I am speaking literally") because it is not so much a question of defining something as effectively drawing a

0 1874: THREE NOVELLAS, OR "WHAT HAPPENED?" □ 201 line; not a line of writing but a line of rigid segmentarity along which every one will be judged and rectified according to his or her contours, individual or collective. Very different is the situation of those with long-distance vision, the far-seers, with all their ambiguities. There are very few of them, at most one per segment. Their telescopes are complex and refined. But they are in no way leaders. And what they see is entirely different from what the others see. They see a whole microsegmentarity, details of details, "a roller coaster of possibilities," tiny movements that have not reached the edge, lines or vibrations that start to form long before there are outlined shapes, "segments that move by jerks." A whole rhizome, a molecular segmentarity that does not permit itself to be overcoded by a signifier like the cutting machine, or even to be attributed to a given figure, a given aggregate or element. This second line is inseparable from the anonymous segmentation that produces it and challenges everything all the time, without goal or reason: "What happened?" The far-seers can divine the future, but always in the form of a becoming of something that has already happened in a molecular matter; unfindable particles. The situation is the same in biology: the great cellular divisions and dichotomies, with their contours, are accompanied by migrations, invaginations, displacements, and morphogenetic impulses whose segments are marked not by localizable points but by thresholds of intensity passing underneath, mitoses that scramble everything, and molecular lines that intersect each other within the large-scale cells and between their breaks. The situation is the same in a society: rigid segments and overcutting segments are crosscut underneath by segmentations of another nature. But this is neither one nor the other, neither biology nor a society; nor is it a resemblance between the two: "I am speaking literally," I am drawing lines, lines of writing, and life passes between the lines. A line of supple segmentarity formed and became entangled with the other, but it was a very different kind of line, shakily drawn by the micro-politics of the far-seers. It is a political affair, as worldwide in scope as the other, but on a scale and in a form that is incommensurable, nonsuperpos-able. It is also a perceptual affair, for perception always goes hand in hand with semiotics, practice, politics, theory. One sees, speaks and thinks on a given scale, and according to a given line that may or may not conjugate with the other's line, even if the other is still oneself. If it does not, then you should not insist, you should not argue; you should flee, flee, even saying as you go, "Okay, okay, you win." It's no use talking; you first have to change telescopes, mouths, and teeth, all of the segments. Not only does one speak literally, one also lives literally, in other words, following lines, whether connectable or not, even heterogeneous ones. Sometimes it doesn't work when they are homogeneous."

0 202 □ 1874: THREE NOVELLAS, OR "WHAT HAPPENED?" The ambiguity of the far-seers' situation is that they are able to detect the slightest microinfraction in the abyss, things the others do not see; they also observe, beneath its apparent geometrical justice, the dreadful damage caused by the Cutting Telescope. They feel as though they foresee things and are ahead of the others because they see the smallest thing as already having happened; but they know that their warnings are to no avail because the cutting telescope will set everything straight without being warned, without the need for or possibility of prediction. At times they feel that they do indeed see something the others do not, but at other times that what they see differs only in degree and serves no purpose. Although they are collaborators with the most rigid and cruelest project of control, how could they not feel a vague sympathy for the subterranean activity revealed to them? An ambiguity in the molecular line, *as if it vacillated between two  sides. *One day (what will have happened?), a far-seer will abandon his or her segment and start walking across a narrow overpass above the dark abyss, will break his or her telescope and depart on a line of flight to meet a blind Double approaching from the other side. Individual or group, we are traversed by lines, meridians, geodesies, tropics, and zones marching to different beats and differing in nature. We said that we are composed of lines, three kinds of lines. Or rather, of bun dles of lines, for each kind is multiple. We may be more interested in a cer tain line than in the others, and perhaps there is indeed one that is, not determining, but of greater importance . . . if it is there. For some of these lines are imposed on us from outside, at least in part. Others sprout up somewhat by chance, from a trifle, why we will never know. Others can be invented, drawn, without a model and without chance: we must invent our lines of flight, if we are able, and the only way we can invent them is by effectively drawing them, in our lives. Aren't lines of flight the most diffi cult of all? Certain groups or people have none and never will. Certain groups or people lack a given kind of line, or have lost it. The painter Flor ence Julien has a special interest in lines of flight: she invented a procedure by which she extracts from photographs lines that are nearly abstract and formless. But once again, there is a bundle of very diverse lines: the line of flight of children leaving school at a run is different from that of demon strators chased by the police, or of a prisoner breaking out. There are differ ent animal lines of flight: each species, each individual, has its own. Fernand Deligny transcribes the lines and paths of autistic children by means of *maps: *he carefully distinguishes "lines of drift" and "customary lines." This does not only apply to walking; he also makes maps of percep tions and maps of gestures (cooking or collecting wood) showing custom ary gestures and gestures of drift. The same goes for language, if it is

A line of drift intersects a customary line, and at that point the child does something not quite belonging to either one: he or she finds something he or she lost— what happened?—or jumps and claps his or her hands, a slight and rapid movement—and that gesture in turn emits several lines.' 2 In short, *there is * *a line of flight, which is already complex since it has singularities; and there  a customary or molar line with segments; and between the two (?), there is a  molecular line with quanta that cause it to tip to one side or the other.* As Deligny says, it should be borne in mind that these lines mean noth ing. It is an affair of cartography. They compose us, as they compose our map. They transform themselves and may even cross over into one another. Rhizome. It is certain that they have nothing to do with language; it is, on the contrary, language that must follow them, it is writing that must take sustenance from them, *between *its own lines. It is certain that they have nothing to do with a signifier, the determination of a subject by the signifier; instead, the signifier arises at the most rigidified level of one of the lines, and the subject is spawned at the lowest level. It is certain that they have nothing to do with a structure, which is never occupied by any thing more than points and positions, by arborescences, and which always forms a closed system, precisely in order to prevent escape. Deligny invokes a common Body upon which these lines are inscribed as so many segments, thresholds, or quanta, territorialities, deterritorializations, or reterritorializations. The lines are inscribed on a Body without Organs, upon which everything is drawn and flees, which is itself an abstract line with neither imaginary figures nor symbolic functions: the real of the BwO.  *This body is the only practical object of schizoanalysis: *What is your body without organs? What are your lines? What map are you in the process of making or rearranging? What abstract line will you draw, and at what price, for yourself and for others? What is your line of flight? What is your BwO, merged with that line? Are you cracking up? Are you going to crack up? Are you deterritorializing? Which lines are you severing, and which are you extending or resuming? Schizoanalysis does not pertain to elements or aggregates, nor to subjects, relations, or structures. It pertains only to *linea-  ments *running through groups as well as individuals. Schizoanalysis, as the analysis of desire, is immediately practical and political, whether it is a question of an individual, group, or society. For politics precedes being. Practice does not come after the emplacement of the terms and their rela tions, but actively participates in the drawing of the lines; it confronts the same dangers and the same variations as the emplacement does. Schizoanalysis is like the art of the new. Or rather, there is no problem of application: the lines it brings out could equally be the lines of a life, a work

0 204 □ 1874: THREE NOVELLAS, OR "WHAT HAPPENED?" of literature or art, or a society, depending on which system of coordinates is chosen. Line of molar or rigid segmentarity, line of molecular or supple seg mentation, line of flight—many problems arise. The first concerns the  *particular character of each line. *It might be thought that rigid segments are socially determined, predetermined, overcoded by the State; there may be a tendency to construe supple segmentarity as an interior activity, something imaginary or phantasmic. As for the line of flight, would it not be entirely personal, the way in which an individual escapes on his or her own account, escapes "responsibilities," escapes the world, takes refuge in the desert, or else in art... ? False impression. Supple segmentarity has nothing to do with the imaginary, and micropolitics is no less extensive or real than macropolitics. Politics on the grand scale can never administer its molar segments without also dealing with the micro injections or infiltrations that work in its favor or present an obstacle to it; indeed, the larger the molar aggregates, the greater the molecularization of the agencies they put into play. Lines of flight, for their part, never con sist in running away from the world but rather in causing runoffs, as when you drill a hole in a pipe; there is no social system that does not leak from all directions, even if it makes its segments increasingly rigid in order to seal the lines of flight. There is nothing imaginary, nothing symbolic, about a line of flight. There is nothing more active than a line of flight, among animals or humans. 13 Even History is forced to take that route rather than proceeding by "signifying breaks." What is escaping in a soci ety at a given moment? It is on lines of flight that new weapons are invented, to be turned against the heavy arms of the State. "I may be run ning, but I'm looking for a gun as I go" (George Jackson). It was along lines of flight that the nomads swept away everything in their path and found new weapons, leaving the Pharaoh thunderstruck. It is possible for a sin gle group, or a single individual even, to exhibit all the lines we have been discussing simultaneously. But it is most frequently the case that a single group or individual functions as a line of flight; that group or individual creates the line rather than following it, is itself the living weapon it forges rather than stealing one. Lines of flight are realities; they are very danger ous for societies, although they can get by without them, and sometimes manage to keep them to a minimum. The second problem concerns *the respective importance of the lines. * You can begin with the rigid segmentarity, it's the easiest, it's pregiven; and then you can look at how and to what extent it is crosscut by a supple segmentarity, a kind of rhizome surrounding its roots. Then you can look at how the line of flight enters in. And alliances and battles. But it is also possible to begin with the line of flight: perhaps this is the primary line,

It is clear that the line of flight *does  not come afterward; *it is there from the beginning, even if it awaits its hour, and waits for the others to explode. Supple segmentarity, then, is only a kind of compromise operating by relative deterritorializations and permitting reterritorializations that cause blockages and reversions to the rigid line. It is odd how supple segmentarity is caught between the two other lines, ready to tip to one side or the other; such is its ambiguity. It is also necessary to look at the various combinations: it is quite possible that one group or individual's line of flight may not work to benefit that of another group or individual; it may on the contrary block it, plug it, throw it even deeper into rigid segmentarity. It can happen in love that one per son's creative line is the other's imprisonment. The composition of the lines, of one line with another, is a problem, even of two lines of the same type. There is no assurance that two lines of flight will prove compatible, compossible. There is no assurance that the body without organs will be easy to compose. There is no assurance that a love, or a political ap proach, will withstand it. Third problem: there is a *mutual immanence *of the lines. And it is not easy to sort them out. No one of them is transcendent, each is at work within the others. Immanence everywhere. Lines of flight are immanent to the social field. Supple segmentarity continually dismantles the concre tions of rigid segmentarity, but everything that it dismantles it reassembles on its own level: micro-Oedipuses, microformations of power, microfascisms. The line of flight blasts the two segmentary series apart; but it is capable of the worst, of bouncing off the wall, falling into a black hole, taking the path of greatest regression, and in its vagaries reconstructing the most rigid of segments. Have you sown your wild oats? That is worse than not escaping at all: See Lawrence's reproach to Melville. 14 Between the matter of a dirty little secret in rigid segmentarity, the empty form of "What happened?" in supple segmentarity, and clandestinity of what can no longer happen on the line of flight, how can we fail to see the upheavals caused by a monster force, the Secret, threatening to bring everything tum bling down? Between the Couple of the first kind of segmentarity, the Dou ble of the second, and the Clandestine of the line of flight, there are so many possible mixtures and passages. There is one last problem, the most anguishing one, concerning *the dan-* *gers specific to each line. *There is not much to say about the danger con fronting the first, for the chances are slim that its rigidification will fail. There is not much to say about the ambiguity of the second. But why is the line of flight, even aside from the danger it runs of reverting to one of the other two lines, imbued with such singular despair in spite of its message of joy, as if at the very moment things are coming to a resolution its undertak

Shestov said of Chekhov, a great creator of novellas: "There can be practically no doubt that Chekhov exerted himself, and something broke inside him. And the overstrain came not from hard and heavy labor; no mighty overpowering exploit broke him: he stumbled and fell, he slipped. . . . The old Chekhov of gaiety and mirth is no more. . . . Instead, a morose and overshadowed man, a 'criminal.' " 15 *What happened? *Once again, this is the question facing all of Chekhov's characters. Is it not possi ble to exert oneself, and even break something, without falling into a black hole of bitterness and sand? But did Chekhov really fall? Is that not to judge him entirely from the outside? Was Chekhov not correct in saying that however grim his characters are, he still carries "a hundred pounds of love"? Of course, nothing is easy on the lines that compose us, and that con stitute the essence of the Novella *(la Nouvelle), *and sometimes of Good News *(la Bonne Nouvelle).* What are your couples, your doubles, your clandestines, and what are their mixes? When one person says to another, love the taste of whiskey on my lips like I love the gleam of madness in your eyes, what lines are they in the process of composing, or, on the contrary, making incompossible? Fitzgerald: "Perhaps fifty percent of our friends and relations will tell you in good faith that it was my drinking that drove Zelda mad, and the other half would assure you that it was her madness that drove me to drink. Nei ther of these judgments means much of anything. These two groups of friends and relations would be unanimous in saying that each of us would have been much better off without the other. The irony is that we have never been more in love with each other in all of our lives. She loves the alcohol on my lips. I cherish her most extravagant hallucinations." "In the end, nothing really had much importance. We destroyed ourselves. But in all honesty, I never thought we destroyed each other." Beautiful texts. All of the lines are there: the lines of family and friends, of all those who speak, explain, and psychoanalyze, assigning rights and wrongs, of the whole binary machine of the Couple, united or divided, in rigid seg-mentarity (50 percent). Then there is the line of supple segmentation, from which the alcoholic and the madwoman extract, as from a kiss on the lips and eyes, the multiplication of a double at the limit of what they can endure in their state and with the tacit understandings serving them as internal messages. Finally, there is a line of flight, all the more shared now that they are separated, or vice versa, each of them the clandestine of the other, a double all the more successful now that nothing has importance any longer, now that everything can begin anew, since they have been destroyed but not by each other. Nothing will enter memory, everything was on the lines, between the lines, in the AND that made one *and *the

9\. 1933: Micropolitics and Segmentarity Segmentarities (Overview of the Types) We are segmented from all around and in every direction. The human being is a segmentary animal. Segmentarity is inherent to all the strata composing us. Dwelling, getting around, working, playing: life is spatially and socially segmented. The house is segmented according to its rooms' assigned pur poses; streets, according to the order of the city; the factory, according to the nature of the work and operations performed in it. We are segmented in a  *binary *fashion, following the great major dualist oppositions: social classes, but also men-women, adults-children, and so on. We are segmented in a *cir-* 208

We are segmented in a *linear *fashion, along a straight line or a number of straight lines, of which each segment represents an episode or "proceeding": as soon as we finish one proceeding we begin another, forever proceduring or procedured, in the family, in school, in the army, on the job. School tells us, "You're not at home anymore"; the army tells us, "You're not in school anymore" . .. Sometimes the various segments belong to different individuals or groups, and sometimes the same individual or group passes from one segment to another. But these figures of segmentarity, the binary, circular, and linear, are bound up with one another, even cross over into each other, changing according to the point of view. This is already evident among "savage" peoples: Lizot shows how the communal House is organized in cir cular fashion, going from interior to exterior in a series of coronas within which certain types of localizable activities take place (worship and ceremo nies, followed by exchange of goods, followed by family life, followed by trash and excrement); at the same time "each of these coronas is itself trans-versally divided, each segment devolves upon a particular lineage and is subdivided among different kinship groups." 1 In a more general context, Levi-Strauss shows that the dualist organization of primitive peoples has a circular form, and also takes a linear form encompassing "any number of groups" (at least three). 2 Why return to the primitives, when it is a question of our own life? The fact is that the notion of segmentarity was constructed by ethnologists to account for so-called primitive societies, which have no fixed, central State apparatus and no global power mechanisms or specialized political institu tions. In these societies, the social segments have a certain leeway, between the two extreme poles of fusion and scission, depending on the task and the situation; there is also considerable communicability between heterogene ous elements, so that one segment can fit with another in a number of different ways; and they have a local construction excluding the prior determination of a base domain (economic, political, juridical, artistic); they have extrinsic and situational properties, or relations irreducible to the intrinsic properties of a structure; activity is continuous, so segmen tarity is not grasped as something separate from a segmentation-in-progress operating by outgrowths, detachments, and mergings. Primitive segmentarity is characterized by a polyvocal *code * based on lineages and their varying situations and relations, and an itinerant *territoriality *based on local, overlapping divisions. Codes and territories, clan lineages and tribal territorialities, form a fabric of relatively supple segmentarity. 3 However, it seems to us difficult to maintain that State societies, even our modern States, are any less segmentary.

0 210 □ 1933: MICROPOLITICS AND SEGMENTARITY between segmentarity and centralization hardly seems relevant. 4 Not only does the State exercise power over the segments it sustains or permits to survive, but it possesses, and imposes, its own segmentarity. Perhaps the opposition sociologists establish between the segmentary and the central is biological deep down: the ringed worm, and the central nervous system. But the central brain itself is a worm, even more segmented than the others, in spite of and including all of its vicarious actions. There is no opposition between the central and the segmentary. The modern political system is a global whole, unified and unifying, but is so because it implies a constella tion of juxtaposed, imbricated, ordered subsystems; the analysis of deci sion making brings to light all kinds of compartmentalizations and partial processes that interconnect, but not without gaps and displacements. Technocracy operates by the segmentary division of labor (this applies to the international division of labor as well). Bureaucracy exists only in com partmentalized offices and functions only by "goal displacements" and the corresponding "dysfunctions." Hierarchy is not simply pyramidal; the boss's office is as much at the end of the hall as on top of the tower. In short, we would say that modern life has not done away with segmentarity but has on the contrary made it exceptionally rigid. Instead of setting up an opposition between the segmentary and the cen tralized, we should make a distinction between two types of segmentarity, one "primitive" and supple, the other "modern" and rigid. This distinction reframes each of the figures previously discussed. 1. Binary oppositions (men/women, those on top/those on the bottom, etc.) are very strong in primitive societies, but seem to be the result of machines and assemblages that are not in themselves binary. The social binarity between men and women in a group applies rules according to which both sexes must take their respective spouses from different groups (which is why there are at least three groups). Thus Levi-Strauss can dem onstrate that dualist organization never stands on its own in this kind of society. On the contrary, it is a particularity of modern societies, or rather State societies, to bring into their own duality machines that function as such, and proceed simultaneously by biunivocal relationships and succes sively by binarized choices. Classes and sexes come in twos, and phenom ena of tripartition result from a transposition of the dual, not the reverse. We have already encountered this, notably in the case of the Face machine, which differs in this respect from primitive head machines. It seems that modern societies elevated dual segmentarity to the level of a self-sufficient organization. The question, therefore, is not whether the status of women, or those on the bottom, is better or worse, but the type of organization from which that status results. 2. Similarly, we may note that in primitive societies circular segmen

0 1933: MICROPOLITICS AND SEGMENTARITY D 211 tarity does not necessarily imply that the circles are concentric, or have the same center. In a supple regime, centers already act as so many *knots, eyes, * or *black holes; *but they do not all resonate together, they do not fall on the same point, they do not converge in the same black hole. There is a multi plicity of animist eyes, each of which is assigned, for example, a particular animal spirit (snake-spirit, woodpecker-spirit, cayman-spirit ...). Each black hole is occupied by a different animal eye. Doubtless, we see opera tions of rigidification and centralization take shape here and there: all of the centers must collect on a single circle, which itself has a single center. The shaman draws lines between all the points or spirits, outlines a constel lation, a radiating set of roots tied to a central tree. This is the birth of a cen tralized power with an arborescent system to discipline the outgrowths of the primitive rhizome. 5 Here, the tree simultaneously plays the role of a principle of dichotomy or binarity, and an axis of rotation. But the power of the shaman is still entirely localized, strictly dependent upon a particular segment, contingent upon drugs, and each point continues to emit inde pendent sequences. The same cannot be said of modern societies, or even of States. Of course, the centralized is not opposed to the segmentary, and the circles remain distinct. But they become concentric, definitively arborified. The segmentarity becomes rigid, to the extent that all centers resonate in, and all black holes fall on, a single point of accumulation that is like a point of intersection somewhere behind the eyes. The face of the father, teacher, colonel, boss, enter into redundancy, refer back to a center of signifiance that moves across the various circles and passes back over all of the segments. The supple microheads with animal facializations are replaced by a macroface whose center is everywhere and circumference nowhere. There are no longer *n *eyes in the sky, or in becomings-animal and -vegetable, but a central computing eye scanning all of the radii. The cen tral State is constituted not by the abolition of circular segmentarity but by a concentricity of distinct circles, or the organization of a resonance among centers. *There are already just as many power centers in primitive societies;  or, if one prefers, there are still just as many in State societies. *The latter, however, behave as apparatuses of resonance; they organize resonance, whereas the former inhibit it. 6 3\. Finally, in the case of linear segmentarity, we would say that each seg ment is underscored, rectified, and homogenized in its own right, but also in relation to the others. Not only does each have its own unit of measure, but there is an equivalence and translatability between units. The central eye has as its correlate a space through which it moves, but it itself remains invariant in relation to its movements. With the Greek city-state and Cleisthenes' reform, a homogeneous and isotopic space appears that overcodes the lineal segments, at the same time as distinct focal points

0 212 □ 1933: MICROPOLITICS AND SEGMENTARITY begin to resonate in a center acting as their common denominator. 7 Paul Virilio shows that after the Greek city-state, the Roman Empire imposes a geometrical or *linear reason of State *including a general outline of camps and fortifications, a universal art of "marking boundaries by lines," a laying-out of territories, a substitution of space for places and territoriali ties, and a transformation of the world into the city; in short, an increas ingly rigid segmentarity. 8 The segments, once underscored or overcoded, seem to lose their ability to bud, they seem to lose their dynamic relation to segmentations-in-progress, or in the act of coming together or coming apart. If there exists a primitive "geometry" (a protogeometry), it is an operative geometry in which figures are never separable from the affecta tions befalling them, the lines of their becoming, the segments of their seg mentation: there is "roundness," but no circle, "alignments," but no straight line, etc. On the contrary, State geometry, or rather the bond between the State and geometry, manifests itself in the primacy of the theorem-element, which substitutes fixed or ideal essences for supple mor phological formations, properties for affects, predetermined segments for segmentations-in-progress. Geometry and arithmetic take on the power of the scalpel. Private property implies a space that has been overcoded and gridded by surveying. Not only does each line have its segments, but the segments of one line correspond to those of another; for example, the wage regime establishes a correspondence between monetary segments, produc tion segments, and consumable-goods segments. We may summarize the principal differences between rigid segmentarity and supple segmentarity. In the rigid mode, binary segmentarity stands on its own and is governed by great machines of direct binarization, whereas in the other mode, binarities result from "multiplicities of *n *dimensions." Sec ond, circular segmentarity tends to become concentric, in other words, causes all of its focal points to coincide in a single center that is in constant movement but remains invariant through its movements, and is part of a machine of resonance. Finally, linear segmentarity feeds into a machine of overcoding that constitutes *more geometrico *homogeneous space and extracts segments that are determinate as to their substance, form, and rela tions. It will be noted that this rigid segmentarity is always expressed by the Tree. The Tree is the knot of arborescence or principle of dichotomy; it is the axis of'rotation guaranteeing concentricity; it is the structure or network gridding the possible. This opposition between arborified and rhizomatic segmentarity is not just meant to indicate two states of a single process, but also to isolate two different processes. For primitive societies operate essen tially by codes and territorialities. It is in fact the distinction between these two elements, the tribal system of territories and the clan system of lineages, that prevents resonance. 9 Modern, or State, societies, on the other hand,

0 1933: MICROPOLITICS AND SEGMENTARITY □ 213 have replaced the declining codes with a univocal overcoding, and the lost territories with a specific reterritorialization (which takes place in an overcoded geometrical space). Segmentarity is always the result of an abstract machine, but different abstract machines operate in the rigid and the supple. It is not enough, therefore, to oppose the centralized to the segmentary. Nor is it enough to oppose two kinds of segmentarity, one supple and prim itive, the other modern and rigidified. There is indeed a distinction between the two, but they are inseparable, they overlap, they are entangled. Primitive societies have nuclei of rigidity or arborification that as much anticipate the State as ward it off. Conversely, our societies are still suf fused by a supple fabric without which their rigid segments would not hold. Supple segmentarity cannot be restricted to primitive peoples. It is not the vestige of the savage within us but a perfectly contemporary function, inseparable from the other. Every society, and every individual, are thus plied by both segmentarities simultaneously: one molar, the other *molecu-  lar. *If they are distinct, it is because they do not have the same terms or the same relations or the same nature or even the same type of multiplicity. If they are inseparable, it is because they coexist and cross over into each other. The configurations differ, for example, between the primitives and us, but the two segmentarities are always in presupposition. In short, every thing is political, but every politics is simultaneously a *macropolitics *and a  *micropolitics. *Take aggregates of the perception or feeling type: their molar organization, their rigid segmentarity, does not preclude the existence of an entire world of unconscious micropercepts, unconscious affects, fine segmentations that grasp or experience different things, are distributed and operate differently. There is a micropolitics of perception, affection, conversation, and so forth. If we consider the great binary aggregates, such as the sexes or classes, it is evident that they also cross over into molecular assemblages of a different nature, and that there is a double reciprocal dependency between them. For the two sexes imply a multiplicity of molec ular combinations bringing into play not only the man in the woman and the woman in the man, but the relation of each to the animal, the plant, etc.: a thousand tiny sexes. And social classes themselves imply "masses" that do not have the same kind of movement, distribution, or objectives and do not wage the same kind of struggle. Attempts to distinguish mass from class effectively tend toward this limit: *the notion of mass is a molecular notion * operating according to a type of segmentation irreducible to the molar segmentarity of class. Yet classes are indeed fashioned from masses; they crystallize them. And masses are constantly flowing or leaking from classes. Their reciprocal presupposition, however, does not preclude a dif

214 □ 1933: MICROPOLITICS AND SEGMENTARITY ference in viewpoint, nature, scale, and function (understood in this way, the notion of mass has entirely different connotations than Canetti's "crowd"). It is not sufficient to define bureaucracy by a rigid segmentarity with compartmentalization of contiguous offices, an office manager in each segment, and the corresponding centralization at the end of the hall or on top of the tower. For at the same time there is a whole bureaucratic segmen tation, a suppleness of and communication between offices, a bureaucratic perversion, a permanent inventiveness or creativity practiced even against administrative regulations. If Kafka is the greatest theorist of bureaucracy, it is because he shows how, at a certain level (but which one? it is not localizable), the barriers between offices cease to be "a definite dividing line" and are immersed in a molecular medium *(milieu) *that dissolves them and simultaneously makes the office manager proliferate into microfigures impossible to recognize or identify, discernible only when they are centralizable: another regime, coexistent with the separation *and * totalization of the rigid segments. I0 We would even say that fascism implies a molecular regime that is distinct both from molar segments and their cen tralization. Doubtless, fascism invented the concept of the totalitarian State, but there is no reason to define fascism by a concept of its own devis ing: there are totalitarian States, of the Stalinist or military dictatorship type, that are not fascist. The concept of the totalitarian State applies only at the macropohtical level, to a rigid segmentarity and a particular mode of totalization and centralization. But fascism is inseparable from a prolifera tion of molecular focuses in interaction, which skip from point to point,  *before *beginning to resonate together in the National Socialist State. Rural fascism and city or neighborhood fascism, youth fascism and war veteran's fascism, fascism of the Left and fascism of the Right, fascism of the couple, family, school, and office: every fascism is defined by a micro-black hole that stands on its own and communicates with the others, before resonat ing in a great, generalized central black hole. 1 ' There is fascism when a *war * *machine *is installed in each hole, in every niche. Even after the National Socialist State had been established, microfascisms persisted that gave it unequaled ability to act upon the "masses." Daniel Guerin is correct to say that if Hitler took power, rather then taking over the German State admin istration, it was because from the beginning he had at his disposal microorganizations giving him "an unequaled, irreplaceable ability to penetrate every cell of society," in other words, a molecular and supple segmentarity, flows capable of suffusing every kind of cell. Conversely, if capitalism came to consider the fascist experience as catastrophic, if it pre ferred to ally itself with Stalinist totalitarianism, which from its point of view was much more sensible and manageable, it was because the

0 1933: MICROPOLITICS AND SEGMENTARITY □ 215 segmentarity and centralization of the latter was more classical and less fluid. What makes fascism dangerous is its molecular or micropolitical power, for it is a mass movement: a cancerous body rather than a totalitar ian organism. American film has often depicted these molecular focal points; band, gang, sect, family, town, neighborhood, vehicle fascisms spare no one. Only microfascism provides an answer to the global ques tion: Why does desire desire its own repression, how can it desire its own repression? The masses certainly do not passively submit to power; nor do they "want" to be repressed, in a kind of masochistic hysteria; nor are they tricked by an ideological lure. Desire is never separable from complex assemblages that necessarily tie into molecular levels, from microforma-tions already shaping postures, attitudes, perceptions, expectations, semiotic systems, etc. Desire is never an undifferentiated instinctual energy, but itself results from a highly developed, engineered setup rich in interactions: a whole supple segmentarity that processes molecular energies and potentially gives desire a fascist determination. Leftist organizations will not be the last to secrete microfascisms. It's too easy to be antifascist on the molar level, and not even see the fascist inside you, the fascist you yourself sustain and nourish and cherish with molecules both personal and collective. Four errors concerning this molecular and supple segmentarity are to be avoided. The first is axiological and consists in believing that a little sup pleness is enough to make things "better." But microfascisms are what make fascism so dangerous, and fine segmentations are as harmful as the most rigid of segments. The second is psychological, as if the molecular were in the realm of the imagination and applied only to the individual and interindividual. But there is just as much social-Real on one line as on the other. Third, the two forms are not simply distinguished by size, as a small form and a large form; although it is true that the molecular works in detail and operates in small groups, this does not mean that it is any less coexten sive with the entire social field than molar organization. Finally, the quali tative difference between the two lines does not preclude their boosting or cutting into each other; there is always a proportional relation between the two, directly or inversely proportional. In the first case, the stronger the molar organization is, the more it induces a molecularization of its own elements, relations, and elementary apparatuses. When the machine becomes planetary or cosmic, there is an increasing tendency for assemblages to miniaturize, to become micro-assemblages. Following Andre Gorz's formula, the only remaining element of work left under world capitalism is the molecular, or molecularized, individual, in other words, the "mass" individual. The administration of a great organized molar security has as its correlate a whole micro

That is what French President Valery Giscard d'Estaing was saying in his military and political geography lesson: the more balanced things are between East and West, in an overcoding and overarmed dualist machine, the more "destabilized" they become along the other, North-South, line. There is always a Palestinian or Basque or Corsican to bring about a "regional destabilization of security." 13 The two great molar aggregates of the East and West are perpetually being undermined by a molecular segmentation causing a zigzag crack, making it difficult for them to keep their own seg ments in line. It is as if a line of flight, perhaps only a tiny trickle to begin with, leaked between the segments, escaping their centralization, eluding their totalization. The profound movements stirring in a society present themselves in this fashion, even if they are necessarily "represented" as a confrontation between molar segments. It is wrongly said (in Marxism in particular) that a society is defined by its contradictions. That is true only on the larger scale of things. From the viewpoint of micropolitics, a society is defined by its lines of flight, which are molecular. There is always some thing that flows or flees, that escapes the binary organizations, the reso nance apparatus, and the overcoding machine: things that are attributed to a "change in values," the youth, women, the mad, etc. May 1968 in France was molecular, making what led up to it all the more imperceptible from the viewpoint of macropolitics. It happens that people who are very lim ited in outlook or are very old grasp the event better than the most advanced politicians, or politicians who consider themselves advanced from the viewpoint of organization. As Gabriel Tarde said, what one needs to know is which peasants, in which areas of the south of France, stopped greeting the local landowners. A very old, outdated landowner can in this case judge things better than a modernist. It was the same with May '68: those who evaluated things in macropohtical terms understood nothing of the event because something unaccountable was escaping. The politicians, the parties, the unions, many leftists, were utterly vexed; they kept repeat ing over and over again that "conditions" were not ripe. It was as though they had been temporarily deprived of the entire dualism machine that made them valid spokespeople. Bizarrely, de Gaulle, and even Pompidou, understood much more than the others. A molecular flow was escaping, minuscule at first, then swelling, without, however, ceasing to be unassignable. The reverse, however, is also true: molecular escapes and movements would be nothing if they did not return to the molar orga

The issue is that the molar and the molecular are distinguished not by size, scale, or dimension but by the nature of the system of reference envi sioned. Perhaps, then, the words "line" and "segment" should be reserved for molar organization, and other, more suitable, words should be sought for molecular composition. And in fact, whenever we can identify a well-defined *segmented line, *we notice that it continues in another form, as a *quantum flow. *And in every instance, we can locate a "power center" at the border between the two, defined not by an absolute exercise of power within its domain but by the relative adaptations and conversions it effects between the line and the flow. Take a monetary flow with segments. These segments can be defined from several points of view, for example, from the viewpoint of a corporate budget (real wages, net profit, management sala ries, interest on assets, reserves, investments, etc.). Now this line of payment-money is linked to another aspect, namely, the flow of financing-money, which has, not segments, but rather poles, singularities, and quanta (the poles of the flow are the creation of money and its destruction; the singularities are nominal liquid assets; the quanta are inflation, deflation, stagflation, etc.). This has led some to speak of a "mutant, convulsive, creative and circulatory flow" tied to desire and always subjacent to the solid line and its segments determining interest rates and supply and demand. 14 In a balance of payment, we again encounter a binary segmentarity that distinguishes, for example, so-called autonomous operations from so-called compensatory operations. But movements of capital do not allow themselves to be segmented in this way; because they are *"the most thoroughly broken down, *according to their nature, duration, and the personality of the creditor or debtor," one "no longer has any idea where to draw the line when dealing with these flows." 15 Yet there is always a correlation between the two aspects since linearization and segmentation are where flows run dry, but are also their point of departure for a new creation. When we talk about banking power, concentrated most notably in the central banks, it is indeed a question of the relative power to regulate "as much as" possible the communication, conversion, and coadaptation of the two parts of the circuit. That is why power centers are defined much more by what escapes them or by their impotence than by their zone of power. In short, the molecular, or microeconomics, micropolitics, is defined not by the smallness of its elements but by the nature of its "mass"—the quantum flow as opposed to the molar segmented line. 16 The task of making the segments correspond to the quanta, of adjusting the segments to the quanta, implies hit-and-miss changes in rhythm and mode rather than any omnipotence; and something always escapes.

0 218 □ 1933: MICROPOLITICS AND SEGMENTARITY We could take other examples, such as the power of the Church. Church power has always been associated with a certain administration of sin possessing a strong segmentarity (the seven deadly sins), units of measure (how many times?), and rules of equivalence and atonement (confession, penance . . .). But there is also what might be called the molecular flow of sinfulness, something quite different yet complementary: it hugs close to the linear zone, as though negotiated through it, but itself has only poles (original sin-redemption or grace) and quanta ("that sin which is the default of consciousness of sin"; the sin of having a consciousness of sin; the sin of the consequence of having a consciousness of sin). 17 The same could be said of a flow of criminality, in contrast to the molar line of a legal code and its divisions. Or to take another example, discussions of military power, or the power of the army, consider a segmentable line broken down into types of war corresponding exactly to the States waging war and the political goals those States assign themselves (from "limited" war to "total" war). But following Clausewitz's intuition, the war machine is very differ ent; it is a flow of *absolute *war stretching between an offensive and a defen sive pole, and is marked only by quanta (psychic and material forces that are like the nominal liquid assets of war). We may say of the pure flow that it is abstract yet real; ideal yet effective; absolute yet "differentiated." It is true that the flow and its quanta can be grasped only by virtue of indexes on the segmented line, but conversely, that line and those indexes exist only by virtue of the flow suffusing them. In every case, it is evident that the seg mented line (macropolitics) is immersed in and prolonged by quantum flows (micropolitics) that continually reshuffle and stir up its segments.

It had been quashed by Durkheim and his school (in polemics similar to and as harsh as Cuvier's against Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire). Durkheim's preferred objects of study were the great collective representations, which are generally binary, resonant, and overcoded. Tarde countered that collective representations presuppose exactly what needs explaining, namely, "the similarity of millions of people." That is why Tarde was interested instead in the world of detail, or of the infini

Tarde's best work was his analy ses of a minuscule bureaucratic innovation, or a linguistic innovation, etc. The Durkheimians answered that what Tarde did was psychology or inter-psychology, not sociology. But that is true only in appearance, as a first approximation: a microimitation does seem to occur between two individuals. But at the same time, and at a deeper level, it has to do not with an individual but with a flow or a wave. *Imitation is the propagation of  a flow; opposition is binarization, the making binary of flows; invention is a  conjugation or connection of different flows. *What, according to Tarde, is a flow? It is belief or desire (the two aspects of every assemblage); a flow is always of belief and of desire. Beliefs and desires are the basis of every society, because they are flows and as such are "quantifiable"; they are veritable social Quantities, whereas sensations are qualitative and representations are simple resultants. 18 Infinitesimal imitation, opposition, and invention are therefore like flow quanta marking a propagation, binarization, or conjugation of beliefs and desires. Hence the importance of statistics, providing it concerns itself with the cutting edges and not only with the "stationary" zone of representations. For in the end, the difference is not at all between the social and the individual (or interindividual), but between the molar realm of representations, individual or collective, and the molecular realm of beliefs and desires in which the distinction between the social and the individual loses all meaning since flows are neither attributable to individuals nor overcodable by collective signifiers. Representations already define large-scale aggregates, or determine segments on a line; beliefs and desires, on the other hand, are flows marked by quanta, flows that are created, exhausted, or transformed, added to one another, subtracted or combined. Tarde invented microsociology and took it to its full breadth and scope, denouncing in advance the misinterpretations to which it would later fall victim. This is how you tell the difference between the segmented line and the quantum flow. A mutant flow always implies something tending to elude or escape the codes; quanta are precisely signs or degrees of deterrito-rialization in the decoded flow. The rigid line, on the other hand, implies an overcoding that substitutes itself for the faltering codes; its segments are like reterritorializations on the overcoding or overcoded line. Let us return to the case of original sin: it is the very act of a flow marking a decoding in relation to creation (with just one last island preserved for the Virgin), and a deterritorialization in relation to the land of Adam; but it simultaneously performs an overcoding by binary organizations and resonance (Powers, Church, empires, rich-poor, men-women, etc.) and complementary reterritorializations (on the land of Cain, on work, on reproduction, on

A social field is always animated by all kinds of movements of decoding and deterritorialization affecting "masses" and operating at different speeds and paces. These are not contradictions but escapes. At this level, everything is a question of *mass. *For example, from the tenth to the four teenth centuries we see an acceleration of factors of decoding and deterri torialization: the masses of the last invaders swooping down from north, east, and south; military masses turned into pillaging bands; ecclesiastical masses confronted with infidels and heretics, and adopting increasingly deterritorialized objectives; peasant masses leaving the seigneurial do mains; seigneurial masses forced to find means of exploitation less terri torial than serfdom; urban masses breaking away from the backcountry and finding increasingly less territorialized social arrangements in the cit ies; women's masses detaching themselves from the old passional and con jugal code; monetary masses that cease to be a hoard object and inject themselves into great commercial circuits. 19 We may cite the Crusades as effecting a connection of flows, each boosting and accelerating the others (even the flow of femininity in the "faraway Princess," even the flow of chil dren in the Crusades of the thirteenth century). But at the same time, and inseparably, there occur overcodings and reterritorializations. The Cru sades were overcoded by the pope and assigned territorial objectives. The Holy Land, the Peace of God, a new type of abbey, new figures of money, new modes of exploitation of the peasant through leasehold and the wage system (or revivals of slavery), urban reterritorializations, etc., form a complex system. At this point, we must introduce a distinction between the two notions of *connection *and *conjugation *of flows. "Connection" indi cates the way in which decoded and deterritorialized flows boost one another, accelerate their shared escape, and augment or stoke their quanta; the "conjugation" of these same flows, on the other hand, indicates their relative stoppage, like a point of accumulation that plugs or seals the lines of flight, performs a general reterritorialization, and brings the flows under the dominance of a single flow capable of overcoding them. But it is pre cisely the most deterritorialized flow, under the first aspect, that always brings about the accumulation or conjunction of the processes, determines the overcoding, and serves as the basis for reterritorialization under the

For example, the merchant bourgeoisie of the cities conju gated or capitalized a domain of knowledge, a technology, assemblages and circuits into whose dependency the nobility, Church, artisans, and even peasants *would enter. *It is precisely because the bourgeoisie was a cutting edge of deterritorialization, a veritable particle accelerator, that it also per formed an overall reterritorialization. The task of the historian is to designate the "period" of coexistence or simultaneity of these two movements (decoding-deterritorialization and overcoding-reterritorialization). For the duration of this period, one distin guishes between the molecular aspect and the molar aspect: on the one hand,  *masses or flows, *with their mutations, quanta of deterritorialization, con nections, and accelerations; on the other hand, *classes or segments, *with their binary organization, resonance, conjunction or accumulation, and line of overcoding favoring one line over the others. 20 The difference between macrohistory and microhistory has nothing to do with the length of the durations envisioned, long or short, but rather concerns distinct systems of reference, depending on whether it is an overcoded segmented line that is under consideration or the mutant quantum flow. The rigid system does not bring the other system to a halt: the flow continues beneath the line, forever mutant, while the line totalizes. *Mass *and *class *do not have the same con tours or the same dynamic, even though the same group can be assigned both signs. The bourgeoisie considered as a mass *and as *a class... The relations of a mass to other masses are not the same as the relations of the "corre sponding" class to the other classes. Of course, there are just as many rela tions of force, and just as much violence, on one side as the other. The point is that the same struggle assumes two very different aspects, in relation to which the victories and defeats differ. Mass movements accelerate and feed into one another (or dim for a long while, enter long stupors), but jump from one class to another, undergo mutation, emanate or emit new quanta that then modify class relations, bring their overcoding and reterritorialization into question, and run new lines of flight in new directions. Beneath the self-reproduction of classes, there is always a variable map of masses. Politics operates by macrodecisions and binary choices, binarized interests; but the realm of the decidable remains very slim. Political decision making necessarily descends into a world of microdeterminations, attractions, and desires, which it must sound out or evaluate in a different fashion. Beneath linear conceptions and segmentary decisions, an evaluation of flows and their quanta. A curious passage by Michelet reproaches Francois I for having badly evaluated the flow of emigration bringing to France large numbers of people in struggle against the Church: Francois saw it only as an influx of

0 222 □ 1933: MICROPOLITICS AND SEGMENTARITY potential soldiers, instead of perceiving a mass molecular flow which France could have used to its own advantage by leading a different Reformation than the one that occurred. 21 Problems are always like this. Good or bad, pol itics and its judgments are always molar, but it is the molecular and its assess ment that makes it or breaks it. Now we are in a better position to draw a map. If we return to a very gen eral sense of the word "line," we see that there are not just two kinds of lines but three. First, a relatively supple line of interlaced codes and territoriali ties; that is why we started with so-called *primitive *segmentarity, in which the social space is constituted by territorial and lineal segmentations. Sec ond, a rigid line, which brings about a dualist organization of segments, a concentricity of circles in resonance, and generalized overcoding; here, the social space implies a *State apparatus. *This system is different from the primitive system precisely because overcoding is not a stronger code, but a specific procedure different from that of codes (similarly, reterrito-rialization is not an added territory, but takes place in a different space than that of territories, namely, overcoded geometrical space). Third, one or several lines of flight, marked by quanta and defined by decoding and deterritorialization (there is always something like a *war  machine *functioning on these lines). This way of presenting things still has the disadvantage of making it seem as though primitive societies came first. In truth, codes are never sep arable from the movement of decoding, nor are territories from the vectors of deterritorialization traversing them. And overcoding and reterrito-rialization do not come after. It would be more accurate to say that there is a space in which the three kinds of closely intermingled lines coexist, tribes, empires, and war machines. We could also put it this way: lines of flight are primary, *or *the already-rigid segments are, and supple segmentations swing between the two. Take a proposition like the following one by the historian Pirenne about barbarian tribes: "The Barbarians did not spontaneously hurl themselves upon the Empire. They were pushed forward by the flood of the Hunnish advance, which in this way caused the whole series of invasions." 22 On one side, we have the rigid segmentarity of the Roman Empire, with its center of resonance and periphery, its State, its *pax romana, *its geometry, its camps, its *limes *(boundary lines). Then, on the horizon, there is an entirely different kind of line, the line of the nomads who come in off the steppes, venture a fluid and active escape, sow deterritorialization everywhere, launch flows whose quanta heat up and are swept along by a Stateless war machine. The migrant barbarians are indeed between the two: they come and go, cross and recross frontiers, pillage and ransom, but also integrate themselves and reterritorialize. At times they

At other times, they will go over to the nomads, allying with them, becoming indiscernible (the brilliant Ostrogoths). Perhaps because they were constantly being defeated by the Huns and Visigoths, the Vandals ("zone-two Goths") drew a line of flight that made them as strong as their masters; they were the only band or mass to cross the Mediterranean. But they were also the ones who produced the most startling reterritorialization: an empire in Africa. 23 Thus it seems that the three lines do not only coexist, but transform themselves into one another, cross over into one another. Again, we have taken a summary example in which the lines are illustrated by different groups. What we have said applies all the more to cases in which all of the lines are in a single group, a single individual. In view of this, it would be better to talk about simultaneous states of the abstract Machine. There is on the one hand an *abstract machine of  overcoding: *it defines a rigid segmentarity, a macrosegmentarity, because it produces or rather reproduces segments, opposing them two by two, mak ing all the centers resonate, and laying out a divisible, homogeneous space striated in all directions. This kind of abstract machine is linked to the State apparatus. We do not, however, equate it with the State apparatus itself. The abstract machine may be defined, for example, *more  geomet-rico, *or under other conditions by an "axiomatic"; but the State apparatus is neither geometry nor axiomatics: it is only the assemblage of reterritorialization effectuating the overcoding machine within given limits and under given conditions. The most we can say is that the State apparatus tends increasingly to identify with the abstract machine it effectuates. This is where the notion of the totalitarian State becomes meaningful: a State becomes totalitarian when, instead of effectuating, within its own limits, the worldwide overcoding machine, it identifies with it, creating the conditions for "autarky," producing a reterritorialization by "closed ves sel," in the artifice of the void (this is never an ideological operation, but rather an economic and political one). 24 On the other hand, at the other pole, there is an abstract machine of mutation, which operates by decoding and deterritorialization. It is what draws the lines of flight: it steers the quantum flows, assures the connec tion-creation of flows, and emits new quanta. It itself is in a state of flight, and erects war machines on its lines. If it constitutes another pole, it is because molar or rigid segments always seal, plug, block the lines of flight, whereas this machine is always making them flow, "between" the rigid seg ments and in another, submolecular, direction. But between the two poles there is also a whole realm of properly molecular negotiation, translation,

All of this happens at the same time. It is at the same time that lines of flight connect and continue their intensities, whip particles-signs out of black holes; and also retreat into the swirl of micro-black holes or molecular conjunctions that interrupt them; or again, enter overcoded, concentricized, binarized, stable segments arrayed around a central black hole. *What is a center or focal point of power? *Answering this question will illustrate the entanglement of the lines. We speak of the power of the army, Church, and school, of public and private power ... Power centers obvi ously involve rigid segments. Each molar segment has one or more centers. It might be objected that the segments themselves presuppose a power cen ter, as what distinguishes and unites them, sets them in opposition and makes them resonate. But there is no contradiction between the segmen tary parts and the centralized apparatus. On the one hand, the most rigid of segmentarities does not preclude centralization: this is because the com mon central point is not where all the other points melt together, but instead acts as a point of resonance on the horizon, behind all the other points. The State is not a point taking all the others upon itself, but a reso nance chamber for them all. Even when the State is totalitarian, its func tion as resonator for distinct centers and segments remains unchanged: the only difference is that it takes place under closed-vessel conditions that increase its internal reach, or couples "resonance" with a "forced move ment." On the other hand, and conversely, the strictest of centralizations does not eradicate the distinctiveness of the centers, segments, and circles. When the overcoding line is drawn, it assures the prevalence of one seg ment, as such, over the other (in the case of binary segmentarity), gives a certain center a power of relative resonance over the others (in the case of circular segmentarity), and underscores the dominant segment through which it itself passes (in the case of linear segmentarity). Thus centraliza tion is always hierarchical, but hierarchy is always segmentary. Each power center is also molecular and exercises its power on a micrological fabric in which it exists only as diffuse, dispersed, geared down, miniaturized, perpetually displaced, acting by fine segmentation, working in detail and in the details of detail. Foucault's analysis of "disci plines" or micropowers (school, army, factory, hospital, etc.) testifies to these "focuses of instability" where groupings and accumulations confront each other, but also confront breakaways and escapes, and where inver sions occur. 25 What we have is no longer The Schoolmaster but the monitor,

Even the warrant officer and janitor are only invoked for explanatory purposes; for they have a molar side *and *a molecular side, and make us realize that the general or the landlord also had both sides all along. We would not say that the proper name loses its power when it enters these zones of indiscernibility, but that it takes on a new kind of power. To talk like Kafka, what we have is no longer the public official Klamm, but maybe his secretary Momus, or other molecular Klamms the differences between which, and with Klamm, are all the greater for no longer being assignable. ("[The officials] don't always stick to the same book, yet it isn't the books they change, but their places, and [they] have to squeeze past one another when they change places, because there's so little room." "This official is rarely very like Klamm, and if he were sitting in his own office at his own desk with his name on the door I would have no more doubt at all," 26 says Barnabas, whose dream would be a uniquely molar segmen-tarity, no matter how rigid and horrendous, as the only guarantee of certainty and security. But he cannot but notice that the molar segments are necessarily immersed in the molecular soup that nourishes them and makes their outlines waver.) And every power center has this microtexture. The microtextures—not masochism—are what explain how the oppressed can take an active role in oppression: the workers of the rich nations actively participate in the exploitation of the Third World, the arming of dictatorships, and the pollution of the atmosphere. This is not surprising since the texture lies between the line of overcoding with rigid segments and the ultimate quantum line. It continu ally swings between the two, now channeling the quantum line back into the segmented line, now causing flows and quanta to escape from the seg mented line. This is the third aspect of power centers, or their limit. For the only purpose these centers have is to translate as best they can flow quanta into line segments (only segments are totalizable, in one way or another). But this is both the principle of their power and the basis of their impo tence. Far from being opposites, power and impotence complement and reinforce each other in a kind of fascinating satisfaction that is found above all in the most mediocre Statesmen, and defines their "glory." For they extract glory from their shortsightedness, and power from their impotence, because it confirms that there is no choice. The only "great" Statesmen are those who connect with flows, like pilot-signs or particles-signs, and who emit quanta that get out of the black holes: it is not by chance that these men encounter each other only on lines of flight, in the act of drawing them, sounding them out, following them, or forging ahead of them, even

But there is no Power regulating the flows themselves. No one dominates the growth of the "monetary mass," or money supply. If an image of the master or an idea of the State is projected outward to the limits of the universe, as if something had domination over flows as well as segments, and in the same manner, the result is a fictitious and ridiculous representation. The stock exchange gives a better image of flows and their quanta than does the State. Capitalists may be the masters of surplus value and its distribution, but they do not dominate the flows from which surplus value derives. Rather, power centers function at the points where flows are converted into seg ments: they are exchangers, converters, oscillators. Not that the segments themselves are governed by a decision-making power. We have seen, on the contrary, that segments (classes, for example) form at the conjunction of masses and deterritorialized flows and that the most deterritorialized flow determines the dominant segment; thus the dollar segment dominates cur rency, the bourgeoisie dominates capitalism, etc. Segments, then, are themselves governed by an abstract machine. But what power centers gov ern are the assemblages that effectuate that abstract machine, in other words, that continually adapt variations in mass and flow to the segments of the rigid line, as a function of a dominant segment and dominated seg ments. Much perverse invention can enter into the adaptations. This is the sense in which we would speak, for example, of banking power (the World Bank, central banks, credit banks): if the flow of financing-money, or credit money, involves the mass of economic transac tions, what banks govern is the conversion of the credit money that has been *created *into segmentary payment-money that is *appropriated, *in other words, coinage or State money for the purchase of goods that are themselves segmented (the importance of the interest rate in this respect). What banks govern is the conversion between the two kinds of money, and the conversion of the segments of the second kind into any given good. 27 The same could be said of every central power. Every central power has three aspects or zones: (1) its zone of power, relating to the segments of a solid rigid line; (2) its zone of indiscernibility, relating to its diffusion throughout a microphysical fabric; (3) its zone of impotence, relatingto the flows and quanta it can only convert without being able to control or define. It is always from the depths of its impotence that each power center draws its power, hence their extreme maliciousness, and vanity. Better to be a tiny quantum flow than a molar converter, oscillator, or distributor! Returning to the example of money, the first zone is represented by the public central banks; the second by the "indefinite series of private rela tions between banks and borrowers"; the third by the desiring flow of

The study of the dangers of each line is the object of pragmatics or schizoanalysis, to the extent that it undertakes not to repre sent, interpret, or symbolize, but only to make maps and draw lines, mark ing their mixtures as well as their distinctions. According to Nietzsche's Zarathustra and Castaneda's Indian Don Juan, there are three or even four dangers: first, Fear, then Clarity, then Power, and finally the great Disgust, the longing to kill and to die, the Passion for abolition. 28 We can guess what fear is. We are always afraid of losing. Our security, the great molar organi zation that sustains us, the arborescences we cling to, the binary machines that give us a well-defined status, the resonances we enter into, the system of overcoding that dominates us—we desire all that. "The values, morals, fatherlands, religions and private certitudes our vanity and self-compla cency generously grant us are so many abodes the world furnishes for those who think on that account that they stand and rest amid stable things; they know nothing of the enormous rout they are heading for... *in flight from  flight."* *29* * *We flee from flight, rigidify our segments, give ourselves over to binary logic; the harder they have been to us on one segment, the harder we will be on another; we reterritorialize on anything available; the only segmentarity we know is molar, at the level of the large-scale aggregates we belong to, as well as at the level of the little groups we get into, as well as at the level of what goes on in our most intimate and private recesses. Every thing is involved: modes of perception, kinds of actions, ways of moving, life-styles, semiotic regimes. A man comes home and says, "Is the grub ready?", and the wife answers, "What a scowl! Are you in a bad mood?": two rigid segments in confrontation. The more rigid the segmentarity, the more reassuring it is for us. That is what fear is, and how it makes us retreat into the first line. The second danger, Clarity, seems less obvious. Clarity, in effect, con cerns the molecular. Once again, everything is involved, even perception, even the semiotic regime, but this time on the second line. Castaneda illus trates, for example, the existence of a molecular perception to which drugs give us access (but so many things can be drugs): we attain a visual and sonorous microperception revealing spaces and voids, like holes in the

That is precisely what clarity is: the distinctions that appear in what used to seem full, the holes in what used to be compact; and conversely, where just before we saw end points of clear-cut segments, now there are indistinct fringes, encroachments, overlappings, migrations, acts of segmentation that no longer coincide with the rigid segmentarity. Every thing now appears supple, with holes in fullness, nebulas in forms, and flut ter in lines. Everything has the clarity of the microscope. We think we have understood everything, and draw conclusions. We are the new knights; we even have a mission. A microphysics of the migrant has replaced the macrogeometry of the sedentary. But this suppleness and clarity do not only present dangers, they are themselves a danger. First, supple segmen tarity runs the risk of reproducing in miniature the affections, the affecta tions, of the rigid: the family is replaced by a community, conjugality by a regime of exchange and migration; worse, micro-Oedipuses crop up, microfascisms lay down the law, the mother feels obliged to titillate her child, the father becomes a mommy. A dark light that falls from no star and emanates such sadness: this shifting segmentarity derives directly from the most rigid, for which it is indirect compensation. The more molar the aggregates become, the more molecular become their elements and the relations between their elements: molecular man for molar humanity. One deterritorializes, massifies, but only in order to knot and annul the mass movements and movements of deterritorialization, to invent all kinds of marginal reterritorializations even worse than the others. But above all, supple segmentarity brings dangers of its own that do not merely reproduce in small scale the dangers of molar segmentarity, which do not derive from them or compensate for them. As we have seen, microfascisms have a spe cificity of their own that can crystallize into a macro fascism, but may also float along the supple line on their own account and suffuse every little cell. A multitude of black holes may very well not become centralized, and acts instead as viruses adapting to the most varied situations, sinking voids in molecular perceptions and semiotics. Interactions without resonance. Instead of the great paranoid fear, we are trapped in a thousand little mono manias, self-evident truths, and clarities that gush from every black hole and no longer form a system, but are only rumble and buzz, blinding lights giving any and everybody the mission of self-appointed judge, dispenser of justice, policeman, neighborhood SS man. We have overcome fear, we have sailed from the shores of security, only to enter a system that is no less concentricized, no less organized: the system of petty insecurities that leads everyone to their own black hole in which to turn dangerous, possess ing a clarity on their situation, role, and mission even more disturbing than the certitudes of the first line.

It stretches from the rigid segments with their overcoding and reso nance to the fine segmentations with their diffusion and interactions, and back again. Every man of power jumps from one line to the other, alternat ing between a petty and a lofty style, the rogue's style and the grandiloquent style, drugstore demagoguery and the imperialism of the high-ranking gov ernment man. But this whole chain and web of power is immersed in a world of mutant flows that eludes them. It is precisely its impotence that makes power so dangerous. The man of power will always want to stop the lines of flight, and to this end to trap and stabilize the mutation machine in the overcoding machine. But he can do so only by creating a void, in other words, by first stabilizing the overcoding machine itself by containing it within the local assemblage charged with effectuating it, in short, by giving the assemblage the dimensions of the machine. This is what takes place in the artificial conditions of totalitarianism or the "closed vessel." But there is a fourth danger as well, and this is the one that interests us most, because it concerns the lines of flight themselves. We may well have presented these lines as a sort of mutation or creation drawn not only in the imagination but also in the very fabric of social reality; we may well have attributed to them the movement of the arrow and the speed of an absolute—but it would be oversimplifying to believe that the only risk they fear and confront is allowing themselves to be recaptured in the end, letting themselves be sealed in, tied up, reknotted, reterritorialized. They them selves emanate a strange despair, like an odor of death and immolation, a state of war from which one returns broken: they have their own dangers distinct from the ones previously discussed. This is exactly what led Fitzgerald to say: "I had a feeling that I was standing at twilight on a deserted range, with an empty rifle in my hands and the targets down. No problem set—simply a silence with only the sound of my own breathing. ... My self-immolation was something sodden-dark." 30 Why is the line of flight a war one risks coming back from defeated, destroyed, after having destroyed everything one could? This, precisely, is the fourth danger: the line of flight crossing the wall, getting out of the black holes, but instead of connecting with other lines and each time augmenting its valence, *turning  to destruction, abolition pure and simple, the passion of abolition. *Like Kleist's line of flight, and the strange war he wages; like suicide, double sui cide, a way out that turns the line of flight into a line of death. We are not invoking any kind of death drive. There are no internal drives in desire, only assemblages. Desire is always assembled; it is what the assemblage determines it to be. The assemblage that draws lines of flight is on the same level as they are, and is of the war machine type. Muta tions spring from this machine, *which in no way has war as its object, *but rather the emission of quanta of deterritorialization, the passage of mutant

0 230 D 1933: MICROPOLITICS AND SEGMENTARITY flows (in this sense, every creation is brought about by a war machine). There are many reasons to believe that the war machine is of a different ori gin, is a different assemblage, than the State apparatus. It is of nomadic ori gin and is directed against the State apparatus. One of the fundamental problems of the State is to appropriate this war machine that is foreign to it and make it a piece in its apparatus, in the form of a stable military institu tion; and the State has always encountered major difficulties in this. It is precisely when the war machine has reached the point that it has no other object but war, it is when it substitutes destruction for mutation, that it frees the most catastrophic charge. Mutation is in no way a transformation of war; on the contrary, war is like the fall or failure of mutation, the only object left for the war machine after it has lost its power to change. War, it must be said, is only the abominable residue of the war machine, either after it has allowed itself to be appropriated by the State apparatus, or even worse, has constructed itself a State apparatus capable only of destruction. When this happens, the war machine no longer draws mutant lines of flight, but a pure, cold line of abolition. (Later, we will propose a theory of the complex relation between the war machine and war.) 31 This brings us back to the paradox of fascism, and the way in which fas cism differs from totalitarianism. For totalitarianism is a State affair: it essentially concerns the relation between the State as a localized assem blage and the abstract machine of overcoding it effectuates. Even in the case of a military dictatorship, it is a State army, not a war machine, that takes power and elevates the State to the totalitarian stage. Totalitarianism is quintessentially conservative. Fascism, on the other hand, involves a war machine. When fascism builds itself a totalitarian State, it is not in the sense of a State army taking power, but of a war machine taking over the State. A bizarre remark by Virilio puts us on the trail: in fascism, the State is far less totalitarian than it is *suicidal. *There is in fascism a realized nihil ism. Unlike the totalitarian State, which does its utmost to seal all possible lines of flight, fascism is constructed on an intense line of flight, which it transforms into a line of pure destruction and abolition. It is curious that from the very beginning the Nazis announced to Germany what they were bringing: at once wedding bells and death, including their own death, and the death of the Germans. They thought they would perish but that their undertaking would be resumed, all across Europe, all over the world, throughout the solar system. And the people cheered, not because they did not understand, but because they wanted that death through the death of others. Like a will to wager everything you have every hand, to stake your own death against the death of others, and measure everything by "deleometers." Klaus Mann's novel, *Mephisto, *gives samplings of entirely ordinary Nazi speeches and conversations: "Heroism was something that

Our beloved Fiihrer is dragging us toward the shades of darkness and everlasting nothingness. How can we poets, we who have a special affinity for darkness and lower depths, not admire him? . . . Fires blazing on the horizon; rivers of blood in all the streets; and the fren zied dancing of the survivors, of *those who are still spared, around the bod-  ies of the dead!"* *32* * *Suicide is presented not as a punishment but as the crowning glory of the death of others. One can always say that it is just a matter of foggy talk and ideology, nothing but ideology. But that is not true. The insufficiency of economic and political definitions of fascism does not simply imply a need to tack on vague, so-called ideological determinations. We prefer to follow Faye's inquiry into the precise formation of Nazi state ments, which are just as much in evidence in politics and economics as in the most absurd of conversations. They always contain the "stupid and repugnant" cry, *Long live death!, *even at the economic level, where the arms expansion replaces growth in consumption and where investment veers from the means of production toward the means of pure destruction. Paul Virilio's analysis strikes us as entirely correct in defining fascism not by the notion of the totalitarian State but by the notion of the suicidal State: so-called total war seems less a State undertaking than an undertaking of a war machine that appropriates the State and channels into it a flow of abso lute war whose only possible outcome is the suicide of the State itself. "The triggering of a hitherto unknown material process, one that is limitless and aimless. . . . Once triggered, its mechanism cannot stop at peace, for the indirect strategy effectively places the dominant powers outside the usual categories of space and time. . . . It was in the horror of daily life and its environment that Hitler finally found his surest means of governing, the legitimation of his policies and military strategy; and it lasted right up to the end, for the ruins and horrors and crimes and chaos of total war, far from discharging the repulsive nature of its power, normally only increase its scope. Telegram 71 is the normal outcome: *If the war is lost, may the  nation perish. *Here, Hitler decides to join forces with his enemies in order to complete the destruction of his own people, by obliterating the last remaining resources of its life-support system, civil reserves of every kind (potable water, fuel, provisions, etc.)." 33 It was this reversion of the line of flight into a line of destruction that already animated the molecular focuses of fascism, and made them interact in a war machine instead of res onating in a State apparatus. *A war machine that no longer had anything  but war as its object *and would rather annihilate its own servants than stop the destruction. All the dangers of the other lines pale by comparison.

0 1730: BECOMING-INTENSE, BECOMING-ANIMAL ... D 233 ***Memories of a Moviegoer. *****I **recall the fine film *Willard *(1972, Daniel Mann). A "B" movie perhaps, but a fine unpopular film: unpopular be cause the heroes are rats. My memory of it is not necessarily accurate. I will recount the story in broad outline. Willard lives with his authoritarian mother in the old family house. Dreadful Oedipal atmosphere. His mother orders him to destroy a litter of rats. He spares one (or two or several). After a violent argument, the mother, who "resembles" a dog, dies. The house is coveted by a businessman, and Willard is in danger of losing it. He likes the principal rat he saved, Ben, who proves to be of prodigious intelligence. There is also a white female rat, Ben's companion. Willard spends all his free time with them. They multiply. Willard takes the rat pack, led by Ben, to the home of the businessman, who is put to a terrible death. But he fool ishly takes his two favorites to the office with him and has no choice but to let the employees kill the white rat. Ben escapes, after throwing Willard a long, hard glare. Willard then experiences a pause in his destiny, in his  *becoming-rat. *He tries with all his might to remain among humans. He even responds to the advances of a young woman in the office who bears a strong "resemblance" to a rat—but it is only a resemblance. One day when he has invited the young woman over, all set to be conjugalized, reoedi-palized, Ben suddenly reappears, full of hate. Willard tries to drive him away, but succeeds only in driving away the young woman: he then is lured to the basement by Ben, where a pack of countless rats is waiting to tear him to shreds. It is like a tale; it is never disturbing. It is all there: there is a becoming-animal not content to proceed by resemblance and for which resemblance, on the contrary, would represent an obstacle or stoppage; the proliferation of rats, the pack, brings a becoming-molecular that undermines the great molar powers of family, career, and conjugality; there is a sinister choice since there is a "favorite" in the pack with which a kind of contract of alliance, a hideous pact, is made; there is the institution of an assemblage, a war machine or criminal machine, which can reach the point of self-destruction; there is a circula tion of impersonal affects, an alternate current that disrupts signifying projects as well as subjective feelings, and constitutes a nonhuman sexual ity; and there is an irresistible deterritorialization that forestalls attempts at professional, conjugal, or Oedipal reterritorialization. (Are there Oedi pal animals with which one can "play Oedipus," play family, my little dog, my little cat, and then other animals that by contrast draw us into an irre sistible becoming? Or another hypothesis: Can the same animal be taken up by two opposing functions and movements, depending on the case?) ***Memories of a Naturalist. ***One of the main problems of natural history was to conceptualize the relationships between animals.

0 234 □ 1730: BECOMING-INTENSE, BECOMING-ANIMAL . . . in this respect from later evolutionism, which defined itself in terms of genealogy, kinship, descent, and filiation. As we know, evolutionism would arrive at the idea of an evolution that does not necessarily operate by filiation. But it was unavoidable that it begin with the genealogical motif. Darwin himself treats the evolutionist theme of kinship and the naturalist theme of the sum and value of differences or resemblances as very separate things: groups that are equally related can display highly variable degrees of difference with respect to the ancestor. Precisely because natural history is concerned primarily with the sum and value of differences, it can con ceive of progressions and regressions, continuities and major breaks, but not an evolution in the strict sense, in other words, the possibility of a descent the *degrees *of modification of which depend on external condi tions. Natural history can think only in terms of relationships (between A and B), not in terms of production (from A to *x).* But something very important transpires at the level of relationships. For natural history conceives of the relationships between animals in two ways: series and structure. In the case of a series, I say *a *resembles *b, b * resembles *c, *etc.; all of these terms conform in varying degrees to a single, eminent term, perfection, or quality as the principle behind the series. This is exactly what the theologians used to call an analogy of proportion. In the case of a structure, I say *a *is to *b *as *c *is to *d; *and each of these relationships realizes after its fashion the perfection under consideration: gills are to breathing under water as lungs are to breathing air; or the heart is to gills as the absence of a heart is to tracheas [in insects]. . . This is an analogy of pro portionality. In the first case, I have resemblances that differ from one another in a single series, and between series. In the second case, I have dif ferences that resemble each other within a single structure, and between structures. The first form of analogy passes for the most sensible and popu lar, and requires imagination; but the kind of imagination it requires is a studious one that has to take branchings in the series into account, fill in apparent ruptures, ward off false resemblances and graduate the true ones, and take both progressions and regressions or degraduations into account. The second form of analogy is considered royal because it requires instead all the resources of understanding *(entendement), *in order to define equiv alent relations by discovering, on the one hand, the independent variables that can be combined to form a structure and, on the other hand, the corre lates that entail one another within each structure. As different as they are, the two themes of series and structure have always coexisted in natural his tory; in appearance contradictory, in practice they have reached a more or less stable compromise. 1 In the same way, the two figures of analogy coex isted in the minds of the theologians in various equilibriums. This is because in both cases Nature is conceived as an enormous *mimesis: *either

D 235 in the form of a chain of beings perpetually imitating one another, progres sively and regressively, and tending toward the divine higher term they all imitate by graduated resemblance, as the model for and principle behind the series; or in the form of a mirror Imitation with nothing left to imitate because it itself is the model everything else imitates, this time by ordered difference. (This mimetic or mimological vision is what made the idea of an evolution-production possible at that moment.) This problem is in no way behind us. Ideas do not die. Not that they survive simply as archaisms. At a given moment they may reach a scien tific stage, and then lose that status or emigrate to other sciences. Their application and status, even their form and content, may change; yet they retain something essential throughout the process, across the displace ment, in the distribution of a new domain. Ideas are always reusable, because they have been usable before, but in the most varied of actual modes. For, on the one hand, the relationships between animals are the object not only of science but also of dreams, symbolism, art and poetry, practice and practical use. And on the other hand, the relationships between animals are bound up with the relations between man and ani mal, man and woman, man and child, man and the elements, man and the physical and microphysical universe. The twofold idea "series-structure" crosses a scientific threshold at a certain moment; but it did not start there and it does not stay there, or else crosses over into other sciences, animating, for example, the human sciences, serving in the study of dreams, myths, and organizations. The history of ideas should never be continuous; it should be wary of resemblances, but also of descents or filiations; it should be content to mark the thresholds through which an idea passes, the journeys it takes that change its nature or object. Yet the objective relationships between animals have been applied to certain sub jective relations between man and animal, from the standpoint of a col lective imagination or a faculty of social understanding. Jung elaborated a theory of the Archetype as collective unconscious; it assigns the animal a particularly important role in dreams, myths, and human collectivities. The animal is inseparable from a *series *exhibiting the double aspect of progression-regression, in which each term plays the role of a possible transformer of the libido (metamorphosis). A whole approach to the dream follows from this; given a troubling image, it becomes a ques tion of integrating it into its archetypal series. That series may include fem inine, masculine, or infantile sequences, as well as animal, vegetable, even elementary or molecular sequences. In contrast to natural history, man is now no longer the eminent term of the series; that term may be an animal for man, the lion, crab, bird of prey, or louse, in relation to a given act or function, in accordance with a given demand of the unconscious.

236 D 1730: BECOMING-INTENSE, BECOMING-ANIMAL .. . Bachelard wrote a fine Jungian book when he elaborated the ramified series of Lautreamont, taking into account the speed coefficient of the metamorphoses and the degree of perfection of each term in relation to a pure aggressiveness as the principle of the series: the serpent's fang, the horn of the rhinoceros, the dog's tooth, the owl's beak; and higher up, the claw of the eagle or the vulture, the pincer of the crab, the legs of the louse, the suckers of the octopus. Throughout Jung's work a process of mimesis brings nature and culture together in its net, by means of analogies of pro portion in which the series and their terms, and above all the animals occu pying a middle position, assure cycles of conversion nature-culture-nature: archetypes as "analogical representations." 2 Is it by chance that structuralism so strongly denounced the prestige accorded the imagination, the establishment of resemblances in a series, the imitation pervading the entire series and carrying it to its term, and the identification with this final term? Nothing is more explicit than Levi-Strauss's famous texts on totemism: transcend external resem blances to arrive at *internal homologies.* *3* * *It is no longer a question of instituting a serial organization of the imaginary, but instead a symbolic and structural order of understanding. It is no longer a question of gradu ating resemblances, ultimately arriving at an identification between Man and Animal at the heart of a mystical participation. It is a question of ordering differences to arrive at a correspondence of relations. The ani mal is distributed according to differential relations or distinctive oppo sitions between species; the same goes for human beings, according to the groups considered. When analyzing the institution of the totem, we do not say that this group of people identifies with that animal species. We say that what group A is to group B, species A' is to species B'. This method is profoundly different from the preceding one: given two human groups, each with its totem animal, we must discover the way in which the two totems entertain relations analogous to those between the two groups— the Crow is to the Falcon ... The method also applies to Man-child, man-woman relations, etc. If we note, for example, that the warrior has a certain astonishing relation to the young woman, we refrain from establishing an imaginary series tying the two together; instead, we look for a term effecting an equivalence of rela tions. Thus Vernant can say that marriage is to the woman what war is to the man. The result is a homology between the virgin who refuses marriage and the warrior who disguises himself as a woman. 4 In short, symbolic understanding replaces the analogy of proportion with an analogy of pro portionality; the serialization of resemblances with a structuration of dif ferences; the identification of terms with an equality of relations; the metamorphoses of the imagination with conceptual metaphors; the great

D 237 continuity between nature and culture with a deep rift distributing corre spondences without resemblance between the two; the imitation of a pri mal model with a mimesis that is itself primary and without a model. A man can never say: "I am a bull, a wolf.. ." But he can say: "I am to a woman what the bull is to a cow, I am to another man what the wolf is to the sheep." Structuralism represents a great revolution; the whole world becomes more rational. Levi-Strauss is not content to grant the structural model all the prestige of a true classification system; he relegates the serial model to the dark domain of sacrifice, which he depicts as illusory, even devoid of good sense. The *serial theme of sacrifice *must yield to the *struc-  tural theme of the institution of the totem, *correctly understood. But here, as in natural history, many compromises are reached between archetypal series and symbolic structures. 5 ***Memories of a Bergsonian. ***None of the preceding satisfies us, from our restricted viewpoint. We believe in the existence of very special becom ings-animal traversing human beings and sweeping them away, affecting the animal no less than the human. "From 1730 to 1735, all we hear about are vampires." Structuralism clearly does not account for these becomings, since it is designed precisely to deny or at least denigrate their existence: a correspondence of relations does not add up to a becoming. When structuralism encounters becomings of this kind pervading a society, it sees them only as phenomena of degradation representing a deviation from the true order and pertaining to the adventures of diachrony. Yet in his study of myths, Levi-Strauss is always encountering these rapid acts by which a human becomes animal at the same time as the animal becomes ... (Becomes what? Human, or something else?). It is always possible to try to explain these *blocks ofbecomingby *a correspondence between two rela tions, but to do so most certainly impoverishes the phenomenon under study. Must it not be admitted that myth as a frame of classification is quite incapable of registering these becomings, which are more like fragments of tales? Must we not lend credence to Jean Duvignaud's hypothesis that there are "anomic" phenomena pervading societies that are not degrada tions of the mythic order but irreducible dynamisms drawing lines of flight and implying other forms of expression than those of myth, even if myth recapitulates them in its own terms in order to curb them? 6 Does it not seem that alongside the two models, sacrifice and series, totem institution and structure, there is still room for something else, something more secret, more subterranean: *the sorcerer *and becomings (expressed in tales instead of myths or rites)?

0 238 □ 1730: BECOMING-INTENSE, BECOMING-ANIMAL ... structuralist critique of the series seems irrefutable. To become is not to  progress or regress along a series. Above all, becoming does not occur in the  imagination, even when the imagination reaches the highest cosmic or  dynamic level, as in Jung or Bachelard. Becomings-animal are neither  dreams nor phantasies. They are perfectly real. But which reality is at issue  here? For if becoming animal does not consist in playing animal or imitat-  ing an animal, it is clear that the human being does not "really" become an  animal any more than the animal "really" becomes something else. Becom-  ing produces nothing other than itself. We fall into a false alternative if we  say that you either imitate or you are. What is real is the becoming itself, the  block of becoming, not the supposedly fixed terms through which that  which becomes passes. Becoming can and should be qualified as be-  coming-animal even in the absence of a term that would be the animal  become. The becoming-animal of the human being is real, even if the ani-  mal the human being becomes is not; and the becoming-other of the animal  is real, even if that something other it becomes is not. This is the point to  clarify: that a becoming lacks a subject distinct from itself; but also that it  has no term, since its term in turn exists only as taken up in another becom-  ing of which it is the subject, and which coexists, forms a block, with the  first. This is the principle according to which there is a reality specific to  becoming (the Bergsonian idea of a coexistence of very different "dura-  tions," superior or inferior to "ours," all of them in communication). Finally, becoming is not an evolution, at least not an evolution by descent and filiation. Becoming produces nothing by filiation; all filiation  is imaginary. Becoming is always of a different order than filiation. It con-  cerns alliance. If evolution includes any veritable becomings, it is in the  domain of *symbioses *that bring into play beings of totally different scales  and kingdoms, with no possible filiation. There is a block of becoming that  snaps up the wasp and the orchid, but from which no wasp-orchid can ever  descend. There is a block of becoming that takes hold of the cat and  baboon, the alliance between which is effected by a C virus. There is a block  of becoming between young roots and certain microorganisms, the alliance  between which is effected by the materials synthesized in the leaves  (rhizosphere). If there is originality in neoevolutionism, it is attributable in  part to phenomena of this kind in which evolution does not go from some-  thing less differentiated to something more differentiated, in which it  ceases to be a hereditary filiative evolution, becoming communicative or  contagious. Accordingly, the term we would prefer for this form of evolu-  tion between heterogeneous terms is "involution," on the condition that  involution is in no way confused with regression. Becoming is  involu-tionary, involution is creative. To regress is to move in the  direction of

But to involve is to form a block that runs its own line "between" the terms in play and beneath assignable relations. Neoevolutionism seems important for two reasons: the animal is defined not by characteristics (specific, generic, etc.) but by populations that vary from milieu to milieu or within the same milieu; movement occurs not only, or not primarily, by filiative productions but also by transversal communications between heterogeneous populations. Becoming is a rhizome, not a classificatory or genealogical tree. Becom ing is certainly not imitating, or identifying with something; neither is it regressing-progressing; neither is it corresponding, establishing corre sponding relations; neither is it producing, producing a filiation or pro ducing through filiation. Becoming is a verb with a consistency all its own; it does not reduce to, or lead back to, "appearing," "being," "equal ing," or "producing." ***Memories of a Sorcerer, I. ***A becoming-animal always involves a pack, a band, a population, a peopling, in short, a multiplicity. We sorcerers have always known that. It may very well be that other agencies, moreover very different from one another, have a different appraisal of the animal. One may retain or extract from the animal certain characteristics: species and genera, forms and functions, etc. Society and the State need animal charac teristics to use for classifying people; natural history and science need char acteristics in order to classify the animals themselves. Serialism and structuralism either graduate characteristics according to their resem blances, or order them according to their differences. Animal characteris tics can be mythic or scientific. But we are not interested in characteristics; what interests us are modes of expansion, propagation, occupation, conta gion, peopling. I am legion. The Wolf-Man fascinated by several wolves watching him. What would a lone wolf be? Or a whale, a louse, a rat, a fly? Beelzebub is the Devil, but the Devil as lord of the flies. The wolf is not fun damentally a characteristic or a certain number of characteristics; it is a wolfing. The louse is a lousing, and so on. What is a cry independent of the population it appeals to or takes as its witness? Virginia Woolfs experi ences herself not as a monkey or a fish but as a troop of monkeys, a school of fish, according to her variable relations of becoming with the people she approaches. We do not wish to say that certain animals live in packs. We want nothing to do with ridiculous evolutionary classifications a la Lorenz, according to which there are inferior packs and superior societies. What we are saying is that every animal is fundamentally a band, a pack. That it has pack modes, rather than characteristics, even if further distinctions within these modes are called for. It is at this point that the human being encoun ters the animal. We do not become animal without a fascination for the

Or is the multiplicity that fascinates us already related to a multiplicity dwelling within us? In one of his masterpieces, H. P. Lovecraft recounts the story of Randolph Carter, who feels his "self reel and who experiences a fear worse than that of annihilation: "Carters of forms both human and non-human, vertebrate and invertebrate, conscious and mindless, animal and vegetable. And more, there were Carters having nothing in common with earthly life, but moving outrageously amidst backgrounds of other planets and systems and galaxies and cosmic continua. .. . Merging with nothingness is peace ful oblivion; but to be aware of existence and yet to know that one is no longer a definite being distinguished from other beings," nor from all of the becomings running through us, "that is the nameless summit of agony and dread." 7 Hofmannsthal, or rather Lord Chandos, becomes fascinated with a "people" of dying rats, and it is in him, through him, in the interstices of his disrupted self that the "soul of the animal bares its teeth at monsterous fate": 8 not pity, but *unnatural participation. *Then a strange imperative wells up in him: either stop writing, or write like a rat. . . If the writer is a sorcerer, it is because writing is a becoming, writing is traversed by strange becomings that are not becomings-writer, but becomings-rat, becomings-insect, becomings-wolf, etc. We will have to explain why. Many suicides by writers are explained by these unnatural participations, these unnatural nuptials. Writers are sorcerers because they experience the animal as the only population before which they are responsible in principle. The German preromantic Karl Philipp Moritz feels responsible not for the calves that die but before the calves that die and give him the incredible feeling of an unknown Nature—*affect? *For the affect is not a personal feeling, nor is it a characteristic; it is the effectuation of a power of the pack that throws the self into upheaval and makes it reel. Who has not known the violence of these animal sequences, which uproot one from humanity, if only for an instant, making one scrape at one's bread like a rodent or giving one the yellow eyes of a feline? A fearsome involution calling us toward unheard-of becomings. These are not regressions, although fragments of regression, sequences of regression may enter in. We must distinguish three kinds of animals. First, individuated ani mals, family pets, sentimental, Oedipal animals each with its own petty history, "my" cat, "my" dog. These animals invite us to regress, draw us into a narcissistic contemplation, and they are the only kind of animal psy choanalysis understands, the better to discover a daddy, a mommy, a little brother behind them (when psychoanalysis talks about animals, animals learn to laugh): *anyone who likes cats or dogs is a fool. *And then there is a second kind: animals with characteristics or attributes; genus, classifica tion, or State animals; animals as they are treated in the great divine myths,

Finally, there are more demonic animals, pack or affect animals that form a multiplicity, a becoming, a population, a tale . . . Or once again, cannot any animal be treated in all three ways? There is always the possibility that a given animal, a louse, a cheetah or an elephant, will be treated as a pet, my little beast. And at the other extreme, it is also possible for any animal to be treated in the mode of the pack or swarm; that is our way, fellow sorcerers. Even the cat, even the dog. And the shepherd, the animal trainer, the Devil, may have a favorite animal in the pack, although not at all in the way we were just discussing. Yes, any animal is or can be a pack, but to varying degrees of vocation that make it easier or harder to discover the multiplicity, or multiplicity-grade, an animal contains (actually or virtually according to the case). Schools, bands, herds, populations are not inferior social forms; they are affects and powers, involutions that grip every animal in a becom ing just as powerful as that of the human being with the animal. Jorge Luis Borges, an author renowned for his excess of culture, botched at least two books, only the titles of which are nice: first, *A Universal His-  tory of Infamy, *because he did not see the sorcerer's fundamental distinc tion between deception and treason (becomings-animal are there from the start, on the treason side); second, his *Manual de zoolog'iafantastica, *where he not only adopts a composite and bland image of myth but also elimi nates all of the problems of the pack and the corresponding becoming-animal of the human being: "We have deliberately excluded from this manual legends of transformations of the human being, the  *lobizbn, *the werewolf, etc." 10 Borges is interested only in characteristics, even the most fantastic ones, whereas sorcerers know that werewolves are bands, and vampires too, and that bands transform themselves into one another. But what exactly does that mean, the animal as band or pack? Does a band not imply a filiation, bringing us back to the reproduction of given characteristics? How can we conceive of a peopling, a propagation, a becoming that is without filiation or hereditary production? A multiplicity without the unity of an ancestor? It is quite simple; everybody knows it, but it is discussed only in secret. We oppose epidemic to filiation, contagion to heredity, peopling by contagion to sexual reproduction, sexual production. Bands, human or animal, proliferate by contagion, epidemics, battlefields, and catastrophes. Like hybrids, which are in themselves sterile, born of a sexual union that will not reproduce itself, but which begins over again every time, gaining that much more ground. Unnatural participations or nuptials are the true Nature spanning the kingdoms of nature. Propagation by epidemic, by contagion, has nothing to do with filiation by heredity, even if the two themes intermingle and require each other. The vampire

The difference is that contagion, epidemic, involves terms that are entirely heterogeneous: for example, a human being, an animal, and a bacterium, a virus, a molecule, a microorganism. Or in the case of the truffle, a tree, a fly, and a pig. These combinations are neither genetic nor structural; they are interkingdoms, unnatural partici pations. That is the only way Nature operates—against itself. This is a far cry from filiative production or hereditary reproduction, in which the only differences retained are a simple duality between sexes within the same species, and small modifications across generations. For us, on the other hand, there are as many sexes as there are terms in symbiosis, as many dif ferences as elements contributing to a process of contagion. We know that many beings pass between a man and a woman; they come from different worlds, are borne on the wind, form rhizomes around roots; they cannot be understood in terms of production, only in terms of becoming. The Uni verse does not function by filiation. All we are saying is that animals are packs, and that packs form, develop, and are transformed by contagion. These multiplicities with heterogeneous terms, cofunctioning by conta gion, enter certain *assemblages; *it is there that human beings effect their becomings-animal. But we should not confuse these dark assemblages, which stir what is deepest within us, with organizations such as the institu tion of the family and the State apparatus. We could cite hunting societies, war societies, secret societies, crime societies, etc. Becomings-animal are proper to them. We will not expect to find filiative regimes of the family type or modes of classification and attribution of the State or pre-State type or even serial organizations of the religious type. Despite appearances and possible confusions, this is not the site of origin or point of application for myths. These are tales, or narratives and statements of becoming. It is therefore absurd to establish a hierarchy even of animal collectivities from the standpoint of a whimsical evolutionism according to which packs are lower on the scale and are superseded by State or familial societies. On the contrary, there is a difference in nature. The origin of packs is entirely dif ferent from that of families and States; they continually work them from within and trouble them from without, with other forms of content, other forms of expression. The pack is simultaneously an animal reality, and the reality of the becoming-animal of the human being; contagion is simulta neously an animal peopling, and the propagation of the animal peopling of the human being. The hunting machine, the war machine, the crime machine entail all kinds of becomings-animal that are not articulated in myth, *still less in totemism. *Dumezil showed that becomings of this kind pertain essentially to the man of war, but only insofar as he is external to families and States, insofar as he upsets filiations and classifications. The war machine is always exterior to the State, even when the State uses it,

The man of war has an entire becoming that implies multi plicity, celerity, ubiquity, metamorphosis and treason, the power of affect. Wolf-men, bear-men, wildcat-men, men of every animality, secret brother hoods, animate the battlefields. But so do the animal packs used by men in battle, or which trail the battles and take advantage of them. And together they spread contagion. 11 There is a complex aggregate: the becoming-animal of men, packs of animals, elephants and rats, winds and tempests, bacteria sowing contagion. A single *Furor. *War contained zoological sequences before it became bacteriological. It is in war, famine, and epidemic that werewolves and vampires proliferate. Any animal can be swept up in these packs and the corresponding becomings; cats have been seen on the battlefield, and even in armies. That is why the distinction we must make is less between kinds of animals than between the different states according to which they are integrated into family institutions, State apparatuses, war machines, etc. (and what is the relation of the writing machine and the musical machine to becomings-animal?) *Memories of a Sorcerer, II. *Our first principle was: pack and contagion, the contagion of the pack, such is the path becoming-animal takes. But a second principle seemed to tell us the opposite: wherever there is multipli city, you will also find an exceptional individual, and it is with that individ ual that an alliance must be made in order to become-animal. There may be no such thing as a lone wolf, but there is a leader of the pack, a master of the pack, or else the old deposed head of the pack now living alone, there is the Loner, and there is the Demon. Willard has his favorite, the rat Ben, and only becomes-rat through his relation with him, in a kind of alliance of love, then of hate. *Moby-Dick *in its entirety is one of the greatest master pieces of becoming; Captain Ahab has an irresistible becoming-whale, but one that bypasses the pack or the school, operating directly through a mon strous alliance with the Unique, the Leviathan, Moby-Dick. There is always a pact with a demon; the demon sometimes appears as the head of the band, sometimes as the Loner on the sidelines of the pack, and some times as the higher Power *(Puissance) *of the band. The exceptional individ ual has many possible positions. Kafka, another great author of real becomings-animal, sings of mouse society; but Josephine, the mouse singer, sometimes holds a privileged position in the pack, sometimes a position outside the pack, and sometimes slips into and is lost in the ano nymity of the collective statements of the pack. 12 In short, every Animal has its Anomalous. Let us clarify that: every animal swept up in its pack or multiplicity has its anomalous. It has been noted that the origin of the word  *anomal *("anomalous"), an adjective that has fallen into disuse in French, is very different from that of *anormal *("abnormal"): *a-normal, *a Latin

Sorcerers therefore use the old adjec tive "anomalous" to situate the positions of the exceptional individual in the pack. It is always with the Anomalous, Moby-Dick or Josephine, that one enters into alliance to become-animal. It does seem as though there is a contradiction: between the pack and the loner; between mass contagion and preferential alliance; between pure multiplicity and the exceptional individual; between the aleatory aggre gate and a predestined choice. And the contradiction is real: Ahab chooses Moby-Dick, in a choosing that exceeds him and comes from elsewhere, and in so doing breaks with the law of the whalers according to which one should first pursue the pack. Penthesilea shatters the law of the pack, the pack of women, the pack of she-dogs, by choosing Achilles as her favorite enemy. Yet it is by means of this anomalous choice that each enters into his or her becoming-animal, the becoming-dog of Penthesilea, the becoming-whale of Captain Ahab. We sorcerers know quite well that the contradictions are real but that real contradictions are not just for laughs. For the whole question is this: What exactly is the nature of the anomalous? What function does it have in relation to the band, to the pack? It is clear that the anomalous is not simply an exceptional individual; that would be to equate it with the family animal or pet, the Oedipalized animal as psychoanalysis sees it, as the image of the father, etc. Ahab's Moby-Dick is not like the little cat or dog owned by an elderly woman who honors and cherishes it. Lawrence's becoming-tortoise has nothing to do with a sentimental or domestic relation. Lawrence is another of the writers who leave us troubled and filled with admiration because they were able to tie their writing to real and unheard-of becomings. But the objection is raised against Lawrence: "Your tortoises aren't real!" And he answers: Possibly, but my becoming is, my becoming is real, even and especially if you have no way of judging it, because you're just little house dogs . . . 14 The anomalous, the preferential element in the pack, has nothing to do with the preferred, domestic, and psychoanalytic individual. Nor is the anomalous the bearer of a species presenting specific or generic characteristics in their purest state; nor is it a model or unique specimen; nor is it the perfection of a type incarnate; nor is it the eminent term of a series; nor is it the basis of an absolutely harmonious correspondence. The anomalous is neither an individual nor a species; it has only affects, it has neither familiar or subjectified feelings, nor specific or significant characteristics. Human tenderness is as foreign to it

Lovecraft applies the term "Outsider" to this thing or entity, the Thing, which arrives and passes at the edge, which is lin ear yet multiple, "teeming, seething, swelling, foaming, spreading like an infectious disease, this nameless horror." If the anomalous is neither an individual nor a species, then what is it? It is a phenomenon, but a phenomenon of bordering. This is our hypothesis: a multiplicity is defined not by the elements that compose it in extension, not by the characteristics that compose it in comprehension, but by the lines and dimensions it encompasses in "intension." If you change dimen sions, if you add or subtract one, you change multiplicity. Thus there is a borderline for each multiplicity; it is in no way a center but rather the envel oping line or farthest dimension, as a function of which it is possible to count the others, all those lines or dimensions constitute the pack at a given moment (beyond the borderline, the multiplicity changes nature). That is what Captain Ahab says to his first mate: I have no personal history with Moby-Dick, no revenge to take, any more than I have a myth to play out; but I do have a becoming! Moby-Dick is neither an individual nor a genus; he is the borderline, and I have to strike him to get at the pack as a whole, to reach the pack as a whole and pass beyond it. The elements of the pack are only imaginary "dummies," the characteristics of the pack are only sym bolic entities; all that counts is the borderline—the anomalous. "To me, the white whale is that wall, shoved near to me." The white wall. "Some times I think there is naught beyond. But 'tis enough." 15 That the anoma lous is the borderline makes it easier for us to understand the various positions it occupies in relation to the pack or the multiplicity it borders, and the various positions occupied by a fascinated Self *(Moi). *It is now even possible to establish a classification system for packs while avoiding the pitfalls of an evolutionism that sees them only as an inferior collective stage (instead of taking into consideration the particular assemblages they bring into play). In any event, the pack has a borderline, and an anomalous position, whenever in a given space an animal is on the line or in the act of drawing the line in relation to which all the other members of the pack will fall into one of two halves, left or right: a peripheral position, such that it is impossible to tell if the anomalous is still in the band, already outside the band, or at the shifting boundary of the band. Sometimes each and every animal reaches this line or occupies this dynamic position, as in a swarm of mosquitoes, where "each individual moves randomly unless it sees the rest of [the swarm] in the same half-space; then it hurries to re-enter the group. Thus stability is assured in catastrophe by a *barrier."**' *Sometimes it is a specific animal that draws and occupies the borderline, as leader of the pack. Sometimes the borderline is defined or doubled by a being of another nature that no longer belongs to the pack, or never belonged to it, and that

It is true that bands are also undermined by extremely varied forces that establish in them interior centers of the conju gal, familial, or State type, and that make them pass into an entirely differ ent form of sociability, replacing pack affects with family feelings or State intelligibilities. The center, or internal black holes, assumes the principal role. This is what evolutionism sees as progress, this adventure also befalls bands of humans when they reconstitute group familialism, or even authoritarianism or pack fascism. Sorcerers have always held the anomalous position, at the edge of the fields or woods. They haunt the fringes. They are at the borderline of the village, or *between *villages. The important thing is their affinity with alli ance, with the pact, which gives them a status opposed to that of filiation. The relation with the anomalous is one of alliance. The sorcerer has a relation of alliance with the demon as the power of the anomalous. The old-time theologians drew a clear distinction between two kinds of curses against sexuality. The first concerns sexuality as a process of filiation transmitting the original sin. But the second concerns it as a power of alli ance inspiring illicit unions or abominable loves. This differs signifi cantly from the first in that it tends to prevent procreation; since the demon does not himself have the ability to procreate, he must adopt indi rect means (for example, being the female succubus of a man and then becoming the male incubus of a woman, to whom he transmits the man's semen). It is true that the relations between alliance and filiation come to be regulated by laws of marriage, but even then alliance retains a danger ous and contagious power. Leach was able to demonstrate that despite all the exceptions that seemingly disprove the rule, the sorcerer belongs first of all to a group united to the group over which he or she exercises influ ence only by alliance: thus in a matrilineal group we look to the father's side for the sorcerer or witch. And there is an entire evolution of sorcery depending on whether the relation of alliance acquires permanence or assumes political weight. 17 In order to produce werewolves in your own family it is not enough to resemble a wolf, or to live like a wolf: the pact with the Devil must be coupled with an alliance with another family, and it is the return of this alliance to the first family, the reaction of this alli ance on the first family, that produces werewolves by feedback effect. A fine tale by Erckmann and Chatrian, *Hugues-le-loup, *assembles the tradi tions concerning this complex situation. 18 The contradiction between the two themes, "contagion through the ani mal as pack," and "pact with the anomalous as exceptional being," is pro gressively fading. It is with good reason that Leach links the two concepts of

1730: BECOMING-INTENSE, BECOMING-ANIMAL ... D 247 alliance and contagion, pact and epidemic. Analyzing Kachin sorcery, he writes: "Witch influence was thought to be transmitted in the food that the women prepared. . . . Kachin witchcraft is contagious rather than heredi tary ... it is associated with affinity, not filiation." 19 Alliance or the pact is the form of expression for an infection or epidemic constituting the form of content. In sorcery, blood is of the order of contagion and alliance. It can be said that becoming-animal is an affair of sorcery because (1) it implies an initial relation of alliance with a demon; (2) the demon functions as the borderline of an animal pack, into which the human being passes or in which his or her becoming takes place, by contagion; (3) this becoming itself implies a second alliance, with another human group; (4) this new borderline between the two groups guides the contagion of animal and human being within the pack. There is an entire politics of becomings-animal, as well as a politics of sorcery, which is elaborated in assemblages that are neither those of the family nor of religion nor of the State. Instead, they express minoritarian groups, or groups that are oppressed, prohibited, in revolt, or always on the fringe of recognized institutions, groups all the more secret for being extrinsic, in other words, anomic. If becoming-animal takes the form of a Temptation, and of monsters aroused in the imagination by the demon, it is because it is accompanied, at its origin as in its undertaking, by a rupture with the central institutions that have established themselves or seek to become established. Let us cite pell-mell, not as mixes to be made, but as different cases to be studied: becomings-animal in the war machine, wildmen of all kinds (the war machine indeed comes from without, it is extrinsic to the State, which treats the warrior as an anomalous power); becomings-animal in crime societies, leopard-men, crocodile-men (when the State prohibits tribal and local wars); becomings-animal in riot groups (when the Church and State are faced with peasant movements containing a sorcery component, which they repress by setting up a whole trial and legal system designed to expose pacts with the Devil); becomings-animal in asceticism groups, the grazing anchorite or wild-beast anchorite (the asceticism machine is in an anoma lous position, on a line of flight, off to the side of the Church, and disputes the Church's pretension to set itself up as an imperial institution); 20 becomings-animal in societies practicing sexual initiation of the "sacred deflowerer" type, wolf-men, goat-men, etc. (who claim an Alliance supe rior and exterior to the order of families; families have to win from them the right to regulate their own alliances, to determine them according to relations of complementary lines of descent, and to domesticate this unbri dled power of alliance). 21 The politics of becomings-animal remains, of course, extremely ambig uous.

States have always appropriated the war machine in the form of national armies that strictly limit the be comings of the warrior. The Church has always burned sorcerers, or reintegrated anchorites into the toned-down image of a series of saints whose only remaining relation to animals is strangely familiar, domestic. Families have always warded off the demonic Alliance gnawing at them, in order to regulate alliances among themselves as they see fit. We have seen sorcerers serve as leaders, rally to the cause of despotism, create the countersorcery of exorcism, pass over to the side of the family and descent. But this spells the death of the sorcerer, and also the death of becoming. We have seen becoming spawn nothing more than a big domestic dog, as in Henry Miller's damnation ("it would be better to feign, to pretend to be an animal, a dog for example, and catch the bone thrown to me from time to time") or Fitzgerald's ("I will try to be a correct animal though, and if you throw me a bone with enough meat on it I may even lick your hand"). Invert Faust's formula: So that is what it was, the form of the traveling scholar? A mere poodle? 22 *Memories of a Sorcerer, III. *Exclusive importance should not be attached to becomings-animal. Rather, they are segments occupying a median region. On the near side, we encounter becomings-woman, becomings-child (becoming-woman, more than any other becoming, pos sesses a special introductory power; it is not so much that women are witches, but that sorcery proceeds by way of this becoming-woman). On the far side, we find becomings-elementary, -cellular, -molecular, and even becomings-imperceptible. Toward what void does the witch's broom lead? And where is Moby-Dick leading Ahab so silently? Lovecraft's hero encounters strange animals, but he finally reaches the ultimate regions of a Continuum inhabited by unnameable waves and unfindable particles. Sci ence fiction has gone through a whole evolution taking it from animal, veg etable, and mineral becomings to becomings of bacteria, viruses, mole cules, and things imperceptible. 23 The properly musical content of music is plied by becomings-woman, becomings-child, becomings-animal; how ever, it tends, under all sorts of influences, having to do also with the instru ments, to become progressively more molecular in a kind of cosmic lapping through which the inaudible makes itself heard and the impercep tible appears as such: no longer the songbird, but the sound molecule. If the experimentation with drugs has left its mark on everyone, even nonusers, it is because it changed the perceptive coordinates of space-time and introduced us to a universe of microperceptions in which becomings-molecular take over where becomings-animal leave off.

D 249 books clearly illustrate this evolution, or rather this involution, in which the affects of a becoming-dog, for example, are succeeded by those of a becoming-molecular, microperceptions of water, air, etc. A man totters from one door to the next and disappears into thin air: "All I can tell you is that we are fluid, luminous beings made of fibers." 24 All so-called initiatory journeys include these thresholds and doors where becoming itself becomes, and where one changes becoming depending on the "hour" of the world, the circles of hell, or the stages of a journey that sets scales, forms, and cries in variation. From the howling of animals to the wailing of ele ments and particles. Thus packs, or multiplicities, continually transform themselves into each other, cross over into each other. Werewolves become vampires when they die. This is not surprising, since becoming and multiplicity are the same thing. A multiplicity is defined not by its elements, nor by a center of unification or comprehension. It is defined by the number of dimensions it has; it is not divisible, it cannot lose or gain a dimension *without changing  its nature. *Since its variations and dimensions are immanent to it, *it  amounts to the same thing to say that each multiplicity is already composed  of heterogeneous terms in symbiosis, and that a multiplicity is continually  transforming itself into a string of other multiplicities, according to its  thresholds and doors. *For example, the Wolf-Man's pack of wolves also becomes a swarm of bees, and a field of anuses, and a collection of small holes and tiny ulcerations (the theme of contagion): all these heterogene ous elements compose "the" multiplicity of symbiosis and becoming. If we imagined the position of a fascinated Self, it was because the multiplicity toward which it leans, stretching to the breaking point, is the continuation of another multiplicity that works it and strains it from the inside. In fact, the self is only a threshold, a door, a becoming between two multiplicities. Each multiplicity is defined by a borderline functioning as Anomalous, but there is a string of borderlines, a continuous line of borderlines *(fiber) *fol lowing which the multiplicity changes. And at each threshold or door, a new pact? A fiber stretches from a human to an animal, from a human or an animal to molecules, from molecules to particles, and so on to the imper ceptible. Every fiber is a Universe fiber. A fiber strung across borderlines constitutes a line of flight or of deterritorialization. It is evident that the Anomalous, the Outsider, has several functions: not only does it border each multiplicity, of which it determines the temporary or local stability (with the highest number of dimensions possible under the circum stances), not only is it the precondition for the alliance necessary to becom ing, but it also carries the transformations of becoming or crossings of multiplicities always farther down the line of flight. Moby-Dick is the  *White Wall *bordering the pack; he is also the demonic *Term of the Alliance;*

0 250 O 1730: BECOMING-INTENSE, BECOMING-ANIMAL... finally, he is the terrible *Fishing Line *with nothing on the other end, the line that crosses the wall and drags the captain .. . where? Into the void . . . The error we must guard against is to believe that there is a kind of logi cal order to this string, these crossings or transformations. It is already going too far to postulate an order descending from the animal to the vege table, then to molecules, to particles. Each multiplicity is symbiotic; its becoming ties together animals, plants, microorganisms, mad particles, a whole galaxy. Nor is there a preformed logical order to these heterogenei ties, the Wolf-Man's wolves, bees, anuses, little scars. Of course, sorcery always codifies certain transformations of becomings. Take a novel steeped in the traditions of sorcery, Alexandre Dumas's *Menem de loups; * in a first pact, the man of the fringes gets the Devil to agree to make his wishes come true, with the stipulation that a lock of his hair turn red each time he gets a wish. We are in the hair-multiplicity, hair is the borderline. The man himself takes a position on the wolves' borderline, as leader of the pack. Then when he no longer has a single human hair left, a second pact makes him become-wolf himself; it is an endless becoming since he is only vulnerable one day in the year. We are aware that between the hair-multiplicity and the wolf-multiplicity it is always possible to induce an order of resemblance (red like the fur of a wolf); but the resemblance remains quite secondary (the wolf of the transformation is black, with one white hair). In fact, there is a first multiplicity, of hair, taken up in a becoming-red fur; and a second multiplicity, of wolves, which in turn takes up the becoming-animal of the man. Between the two, there is threshold and fiber, symbiosis of or passage between heterogeneities. That is how we sorcerers operate. Not following a logical order, but following alogical con sistencies or compatibilities. The reason is simple. It is because no one, not even God, can say in advance whether two borderlines will string together or form a fiber, whether a given multiplicity will or will not cross over into another given multiplicity, or even if given heterogeneous elements will enter symbiosis, will form a consistent, or cofunctioning, multiplicity sus ceptible to transformation. No one can say where the line of flight will pass: Will it let itself get bogged down and fall back to the Oedipal family animal, a mere poodle? Or will it succumb to another danger, for example, turning into a line of abolition, annihilation, self-destruction, Ahab,Ahab... ?We are all too familiar with the dangers of the line of flight, and with its ambi guities. The risks are ever-present, but it is always possible to have the good fortune of avoiding them. Case by case, we can tell whether the line is con sistent, in other words, whether the heterogeneities effectively function in a multiplicity of symbiosis, whether the multiplicities are effectively trans formed through the becomings of passage. Let us take an example as simple as: *x *starts practicing piano again. Is it an Oedipal return to childhood? Is it

Is it a new borderline, an active line that will bring other becomings entirely different from becom ing or rebecoming a pianist, that will induce a transformation of all of the preceding assemblages to which *x *was prisoner? Is it a way out? Is it a pact with the Devil? Schizoanalysis, or pragmatics, has no other meaning: Make a rhizome. But you don't know what you can make a rhizome with, you don't know which subterranean stem is effectively going to make a rhi zome, or enter a becoming, people your desert. So experiment. That's easy to say? Although there is no preformed logical order to becomings and multiplicities, there are *criteria, *and the important thing is that they not be used after the fact, that they be applied in the course of events, that they be sufficient to guide us through the dangers. If multiplici ties are defined and transformed by the borderline that determines in each instance their number of dimensions, we can conceive of the possibility of laying them out on a plane, the borderlines succeeding one another, form ing a broken line. It is only in appearance that a plane of this kind "reduces" the number of dimensions; for it gathers in all the dimensions to the extent that *flat multiplicities*—which nonetheless have *an increasing or decreas-  ing number of dimensions*—are inscribed upon it. It is in grandiose and simplified terms that Lovecraft attempted to pronounce sorcery's final word: "Then the waves increased in strength and sought to improve his understanding, reconciling him to the multiform entity of which his pres ent fragment was an infinitesimal part. They told him that every figure of space is but the result of the intersection by a plane of some corresponding figure of one more dimension—as a square is cut from a cube, or a circle from a sphere. The cube and sphere, of three dimensions, are thus cut from corresponding forms of four dimensions, which men know only through guesses and dreams; and these in turn are cut from forms of five dimen sions, and so on up to the dizzy and reachless heights of archetypal infin ity." 25 Far from reducing the multiplicities' number of dimensions to two, the *plane of consistency *cuts across them all, intersects them in order to bring into coexistence any number of multiplicities, with any number of dimensions. The plane of consistency is the intersection of all concrete forms. Therefore all becomings are written like sorcerers' drawings on this plane of consistency, which is the ultimate Door providing a way out for them. This is the only criterion to prevent them from bogging down, or veering into the void. The only question is: Does a given becoming reach that point? Can a given multiplicity flatten and conserve all its dimensions in this way, like a pressed flower that remains just as alive dry? Lawrence, in his becoming-tortoise, moves from the most obstinate animal dynamism to the abstract, pure geometry of scales and "cleavages of division," with out, however, losing any of the dynamism: he pushes becoming-tortoise all

It is the Planomenon, or the Rhizosphere, the Criterium (and still other names, as the number of dimensions increases). At *n *dimensions, it is called the Hypersphere, the Mechanosphere. It is the abstract Figure, or rather, since it has no form itself, the abstract Machine of which each concrete assem blage is a multiplicity, a becoming, a segment, a vibration. And the abstract machine is the intersection of them all. Waves are vibrations, shifting borderlines inscribed on the plane of con sistency as so many abstractions. The abstract machine of the waves. In  *The Waves, *Virginia Woolf—who made all of her life and work a passage, a becoming, all kinds of becomings between ages, sexes, elements, and king doms—intermingles seven characters, Bernard, Neville, Louis, Jinny, Rhoda, Suzanne, and Percival. But each of these characters, with his or her name, its individuality, designates a multiplicity (for example, Bernard and the school offish). Each is simultaneously in this multiplicity and at its edge, and crosses over into the others. Percival is like the ultimate multipli city enveloping the greatest number of dimensions. But he is not yet the plane of consistency. Although Rhoda thinks she sees him rising out of the sea, no, it is not he. "When the white arm rests upon the knee it is a triangle; now it is upright—a column; now a fountain.. .. Behind it roars the sea. It is beyond our reach." 27 Each advances like a wave, but on the plane of con sistency they are a single abstract Wave whose vibration propagates follow ing a line of flight or deterritorialization traversing the entire plane (each chapter of Woolf s novel is preceded by a meditation on an aspect of the waves, on one of their hours, on one of their becomings). ***Memories of a Theologian. ***Theology is very strict on the following point: there are no werewolves, human beings cannot become animal. That is because there is no transformation of essential forms; they are inalienable and only entertain relations of analogy. The Devil and the witch, and the pact between them, are no less real for that, for there is in reality a *local  movement *that is properly diabolical. Theology distinguishes two cases, used as models during the Inquisition: that of Ulysses' companions, and that of Diomedes' companions, the imaginary vision and the spell. In the first, the subject believes him- or herself to be transformed into an animal, pig, ox, or wolf, and the observers believe it too; but this is an internal local movement bringing sensible images back to the imagination and bouncing them off external meanings. In the second, the Devil "assumes" real ani mal bodies, even transporting the accidents and affects befalling them to other bodies (for example, a cat or a wolf that has been taken over by the

D 253 Devil can receive wounds that are relayed to an exactly corresponding part of a human body). 28 This is a way of saying that the human being does not become animal in reality, but that there is nevertheless a demonic reality of the becoming-animal of the human being. Therefore it is certain that the demon performs local transports of all kinds. The Devil is a transporter; he transports humors, affects, or even bodies (the Inquisition brooks no com promises on this power of the Devil: the witch's broom, or "the Devil take you"). But these transports cross neither the barrier of essential forms nor that of substances or subjects. There is another, altogether different, problem concerning the laws of nature that has to do not with demonology but with alchemy, and above all physics. It is the problem of accidental forms, distinct from both essential forms and determined subjects. For accidental forms are susceptible to  *more and less: *more or less charitable, but also more or less white, more or less warm. A degree of heat is a perfectly individuated warmth distinct from the substance or the subject that receives it. A degree of heat can enter into composition with a degree of whiteness, or with another degree of heat, to form a third unique individuality distinct from that of the subject. What is the individuality of a day, a season, an event? A shorter day and a longer day are not, strictly speaking, extensions but degrees proper to extension, just as there are degrees proper to heat, color, etc. An accidental form therefore has a "latitude" constituted by a certain number of composable individuations. A degree, an intensity, is an individual, a  *Haecceity *that enters into composition with other degrees, other intensi ties, to form another individual. Can latitude be explained by the fact that the subject participates more or less in the accidental form? But do these degrees of participation not imply a flutter, a vibration in the form itself that is not reducible to the properties of a subject? Moreover, if intensities of heat are not composed by addition, it is because one must add their respective subjects; it is the subjects that prevent the heat of the whole from increasing. All the more reason to effect distributions of intensity, to estab lish latitudes that are "deformedly deformed," speeds, slownesses, and degrees of all kinds corresponding to a body or set of bodies taken as longi tude: a cartography. 29 In short, between substantial forms and determined subjects, *between the two, *there is not only a whole operation of demonic local transports but a natural play of haecceities, degrees, intensities, events, and accidents that compose individuations totally different from those of the well-formed subjects that receive them. ***Memories of a Spinozist, I. ***Substantial or essential forms have been cri tiqued in many different ways.

They are not atoms, in other words, finite elements still endowed with form. Nor are they indefinitely divisible. They are infinitely small, ultimate parts of an actual infinity, laid out on the same plane of consistency or composition. They are not defined by their number since they always come in infinities. However, depending on their degree of speed or the relation of movement and rest into which they enter, they belong to a given Individual, which may itself be part of another Individual governed by another, more complex, relation, and so on to infinity. There are thus smaller and larger infinities, not by virtue of their number, but by virtue of the composition of the relation into which their parts enter. Thus each individual is an infinite multiplicity, and the whole of Nature is a multiplicity of perfectly individuated multiplicities. The plane of consistency of Nature is like an immense Abstract Machine, abstract yet real and individual; its pieces are the various assemblages and individuals, each of which groups together an infinity of particles entering into an infinity of more or less interconnected relations. There is therefore a unity to the plane of nature, which applies equally to the inanimate and the animate, the artificial and the natural. This plane has nothing to do with a form or a figure, nor with a design or a function. Its unity has nothing to do with a ground buried deep within things, nor with an end or a project in the mind of God. Instead, it is a plane upon which everything is laid out, and which is like the intersection of all forms, the machine of all functions; its dimensions, however, increase with those of the multiplicities of indi vidualities it cuts across. It is a fixed plane, upon which things are dis tinguished from one another only by speed and slowness. A plane of immanence or univocality opposed to analogy. The One is said with a single meaning of all the multiple. Being expresses in a single meaning all that differs. What we are talking about is not the unity of substance but the infinity of the modifications that are part of one another on this unique plane of life. The never-ending debate between Cuvier and Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire: both agree at least in denouncing resemblances, or imaginary, sensible analogies, but in Cuvier, scientific definition concerns the relations between organs, and between organs and functions. Cuvier thus takes anal ogy to the scientific stage, making it an analogy of proportionality. The unity of the plane, according to him, can only be a unity of analogy, there fore a transcendent unity that cannot be realized without fragmenting into distinct branches, according to irreducible, uncrossable, heterogeneous compositions. Baer would later add: according to noncommunicating types of development and differentiation. The plane is a hidden plan(e) of organization, a structure or genesis.

Speed and slow ness, movement and rest, tardiness and rapidity subordinate not only the forms of structure but also the types of development. This approach later reappears in an evolutionist framework, with Perrier's tachygenesis and differential rates of growth in allometry: species as kinematic entities that are either precocious or retarded. (Even the question of fertility is less one of form and function than speed; do the paternal chromosomes arrive early enough to be incorporated into the nuclei?) In any case, there is a pure plane of immanence, univocality, composition, upon which everything is given, upon which unformed elements and materials dance that are distin guished from one another only by their speed and that enter into this or that individuated assemblage depending on their connections, their rela tions of movement. A fixed plane of life upon which everything stirs, slows down or accelerates. A single abstract Animal for all the assemblages that effectuate it. A unique plane of consistency or composition for the cephalo-pod and the vertebrate; for the vertebrate to become an Octopus or Cuttlefish, all it would have to do is fold itself in two fast enough to fuse the elements of the halves of its back together, then bring its pelvis up to the nape of its neck and gather its limbs together into one of its extremities, like "a clown who throws his head and shoulders back and walks on his head and hands." 30 *Plication. *It is no longer a question of organs and functions, and of a transcendent Plane that can preside over their organization only by means of analogical relations and types of divergent development. It is a question not of organization but of composition; not of development or differentiation but of movement and rest, speed and slowness. It is a question of elements and particles, which do or do not arrive fast enough to effect a passage, a becoming or jump on the same plane of pure immanence. And if there are in fact jumps, rifts between assemblages, it is not by virtue of their essential irreducibility but rather because there are always elements that do not arrive on time, or arrive after everything is over; thus it is necessary to pass through fog, to cross voids, to have lead times and delays, which are themselves part of the plane of immanence. Even the failures are part of the plane. We must try to conceive of this world in which a single fixed plane—which we shall call a plane of absolute immobility *or *absolute movement—is traversed by nonformal elements of relative speed that enter this or that individuated assemblage depending on their degrees of speed and slowness. A plane of consistency peopled by anonymous matter, by infinite bits of impalpable matter entering into varying connections.

0 256 □ 1730: BECOMING-INTENSE, BECOMING-ANIMAL... Children are Spinozists. When Little Hans talks about a "peepee-maker," he is referring not to an organ or an organic function but basically to a material, in other words, to an aggregate whose elements vary according to its connections, its relations of movement and rest, the different individuated assemblages it enters. Does a girl have a peepee-maker? The boy says yes, and not by analogy, nor in order to conjure away a fear of castration. It is obvious that girls have a peepee-maker because they effectively pee: a machinic functioning rather than an organic function. Quite simply, the same material has different connections, different relations of movement and rest, enters different assemblages in the case of the boy and the girl (a girl does not pee standing or into the distance). Does a locomotive have a peepee-maker? Yes, in yet another machinic assemblage. Chairs don't have them: but that is because the elements of the chair were not able to integrate this material into their relations, or decomposed the relation with that material to the point that it yielded something else, a rung, for example. It has been noted that for children an organ has "a thousand vicissitudes," that it is "difficult to localize, difficult to identify, it is in turn a bone, an engine, excrement, the baby, a hand, daddy's heart..." This is not at all because the organ is experienced as a part-object. It is because the organ is exactly what its elements make it according to their relation of movement or rest, and the way in which this relation combines with or splits off from that of neighboring elements. This is not animism, any more than it is mechanism; rather, it is universal machinism: a plane of consistency occupied by an immense abstract machine comprising an infinite number of assemblages. Children's questions are poorly understood if they are not seen as question-machines; that is why indefinite articles play so important a role in these questions *(a *belly, a child, a horse, a chair, "how is *a *person made?"). Spinozism is the becoming-child of the philosopher. We call the  *longitude *of a body the particle aggregates belonging to that body in a given relation; these aggregates are part of each other depending on the composition of the relation that defines the individuated assemblage of the body. ***Memories of a Spinozist, II. ***There is another aspect to Spinoza. To every relation of movement and rest, speed and slowness grouping together an infinity of parts, there corresponds a degree of power. To the relations com posing, decomposing, or modifying an individual there correspond inten sities that affect it, augmenting or diminishing its power to act; these intensities come from external parts or from the individual's own parts. Affects are becomings. Spinoza asks: What can a body do? We call the *lati-  tude *of a body the affects of which it is capable at a given degree of power, or rather within the limits of that degree. *Latitude is made up of intensive parts*

D 257 *falling under a capacity, and longitude of extensive parts falling under a rela-  tion. *In the same way that we avoided defining a body by its organs and functions, we will avoid defining it by Species or Genus characteristics; instead we will seek to count its affects. This kind of study is called ethology, and this is the sense in which Spinoza wrote a true Ethics. A race horse is more different from a workhorse than a workhorse is from an ox. Von Uexkull, in defining animal worlds, looks for the active and passive affects of which the animal is capable in the individuated assemblage of which it is a part. For example, the Tick, attracted by the light, hoists itself up to the tip of a branch; it is sensitive to the smell of mammals, and lets itself fall when one passes beneath the branch; it digs into its skin, at the least hairy place it can find. Just three affects; the rest of the time the tick sleeps, sometimes for years on end, indifferent to all that goes on in the immense forest. Its degree of power is indeed bounded by two limits: the optimal limit of the feast after which it dies, and the pessimal limit of the fast as it waits. It will be said that the tick's three affects assume generic and specific characteristics, organs and functions, legs and snout. This is true from the standpoint of physiology, but not from the standpoint of Ethics. Quite the contrary, in Ethics the organic characteristics derive from longi tude and its relations, from latitude and its degrees. We know nothing about a body until we know what it can do, in other words, what its affects are, how they can or cannot enter into composition with other affects, with the affects of another body, either to destroy that body or to be destroyed by it, either to exchange actions and passions with it or to join with it in com posing a more powerful body. Once again, we turn to children. Note how they talk about animals, and are moved by them. They make a list of affects. Little Hans's horse is not representative but affective. It is not a member of a species but an element or individual in a machinic assemblage: draft horse-omnibus-street. It is defined by a list of active and passive affects in the context of the individuated assemblage it is part of: having eyes blocked by blinders, hav ing a bit and a bridle, being proud, having a big peepee-maker, pulling heavy loads, being whipped, falling, making a din with its legs, biting, etc. These affects circulate and are transformed within the assemblage: what a horse "can do." They indeed have an optimal limit at the summit of horse power, but also a pessimal threshold: a horse falls down in the street! It can't get back on its feet with that heavy load on its back, and the excessive whip ping; a horse is going to die!—this was an ordinary sight in those days (Nietzsche, Dostoyevsky, Nijinsky lamented it). So just what is the becoming-horse of Little Hans? Hans is also taken up in an assemblage: his mother's bed, the paternal element, the house, the cafe across the street, the nearby warehouse, the street, the right to go out onto the street, the winning

These are not phantasies or subjective reveries: it is not a question of imitating a horse, "playing" horse, identifying with one, or even experiencing feelings of pity or sympathy. Neither does it have to do with an objective analogy between assemblages. The question is whether Little Hans can endow his own elements with the relations of movement and rest, the affects, that would make it become horse, forms and subjects aside. Is there an as yet unknown assemblage that would be neither Hans's nor the horse's, but that of the becoming-horse of Hans? An assemblage, for example, in which the horse would bare its teeth and Hans might show something else, his feet, his legs, his peepee-maker, whatever? And in what way would that ameliorate Hans's problem, to what extent would it open a way out that had been previously blocked? When Hofmannsthal contem plates the death throes of a rat, it is in him that the animal "bares his teeth at monstrous fate." *This is not a feeling of pity, *as he makes clear; still less an identification. It is a composition of speeds and affects involving entirely different individuals, a symbiosis; it makes the rat become a thought, a feverish thought in the man, at the same time as the man becomes a rat gnashing its teeth in its death throes. The rat and the man are in no way the same thing, but Being expresses them both in a single meaning in a lan guage that is no longer that of words, in a matter that is no longer that of forms, in an affectability that is no longer that of subjects. *Unnatural par-  ticipation. *But the plane of composition, the plane of Nature, is precisely for participations of this kind, and continually makes and unmakes their assemblages, employing every artifice. This is not an analogy, or a product of the imagination, but a composi tion of speeds and affects on the plane of consistency: a plan(e), a program, or rather a diagram, a problem, a question-machine. Vladimir Slepian for mulates the "problem" in a thoroughly curious text: I'm hungry, always hungry, a man should not be hungry, so I'll have to become a dog—but how? This will not involve imitating a dog, nor an analogy of relations. I must succeed in endowing the parts of my body with relations of speed and slowness that will make it become dog, in an original assemblage proceed ing neither by resemblance nor by analogy. For I cannot become dog with out the dog itself becoming something else. Slepian gets the idea of using shoes to solve this problem, the artifice of the shoes. If I wear shoes on my hands, then their elements will enter into a new relation, resulting in the affect or becoming I seek. But how will I be able to tie the shoe on my sec ond hand, once the first is already occupied? With my mouth, which in turn receives an investment in the assemblage, becoming a dog muzzle, insofar as a dog muzzle is now used to tie shoes. At each stage of the prob lem, what needs to be done is not to compare two organs but to place ele

But this becoming, which has already taken in feet, hands, and mouth, will nevertheless fail. It founders on the tail. The tail would have had to have been invested, forced to exhibit elements common to the sexual organ and the caudal appendage, so that the former would be taken up in the becoming-dog of the man at the same time as the latter were taken up in a becoming of the dog, in another becom ing that would also be part of the assemblage. The plan(e) fails, Slepian fal ters on this point. The tail remains an organ of the man on the one hand and an appendage of the dog on the other; their relations do not enter into com position in the new assemblage. This is where psychoanalytic drift sets in, bringing back all the cliches about the tail, the mother, the childhood mem ory of the mother threading needles, all those concrete figures and sym bolic analogies. 31 But this is the way Slepian wants it in this fine text. For there is a way in which the failure of the plan(e) is part of the plan(e) itself: The plan(e) is infinite, you can start it in a thousand different ways; you will always find something that comes too late or too early, forcing you to recompose all of your relations of speed and slowness, all of your affects, and to rearrange the overall assemblage. An infinite undertaking. But there is another way in which the plan(e) fails; this time, it is because *another  plan(e) *returns full force, breaking the becoming-animal, folding the ani mal back onto the animal and the person onto the person, recognizing only resemblances between elements and analogies between relations. Slepian confronts both dangers. We wish to make a simple point about psychoanalysis: from the begin ning, it has often encountered the question of the becomings-animal of the human being: in children, who continually undergo becomings of this kind; in fetishism and in particular masochism, which continually con front this problem. The least that can be said is that the psychoanalysts, even Jung, did not understand, or did not want to understand. They killed becoming-animal, in the adult as in the child. They saw nothing. They see the animal as a representative of drives, or a representation of the parents. They do not see the reality of a becoming-animal, that it is affect in itself, the drive in person, and represents nothing. There exist no other drives than the assemblages themselves. There are two classic texts in which Freud sees nothing but the father in the becoming-horse of Hans, and Ferenczi sees the same in the becoming-cock of Arpad. The horse's blind ers are the father's eyeglasses, the black around its mouth is his mustache, its kicks are the parents' "lovemaking." Not one word about Hans's rela tion to the street, on how the street was forbidden to him, on what it is for a child to see the spectacle "a horse is proud, a blinded horse pulls, a horse falls, a horse is whipped..." Psychoanalysis has no feeling for unnatural

Similarly, fewer stupidities would be uttered on the topic of pain, humilia-  tion, and anxiety in masochism if it were understood that it is the  becomings-animal that lead the masochism, not the other way around.  There are always apparatuses, tools, engines involved, there are always  artifices and constraints used in taking Nature to the fullest. That is  because it is necessary to annul the organs, to shut them away so that their  liberated elements can enter into the new relations from which the  becoming-animal, and the circulation of affects within the machinic  assemblage, will result. As we have seen elsewhere, this was the case for the  mask, the bridle, the bit, and the penis sheath in *Equus eroticus: *paradoxi-  cally, in the becoming-horse assemblage the man subdues his own "instinc-  tive" forces while the animal transmits to him its "acquired" forces.  Reversal, unnatural participation. And the boots of the woman-master  function to annul the leg as a human organ, to make the elements of the leg  enter a relation suited to the overall assemblage: "In this way, it will no  longer be women's legs that have an effect on me . . ," 32 But to break the becoming-animal all that is needed is to extract a segment from it, to  abstract one of its moments, to fail to take into account its internal speeds  and slownesses, to arrest the circulation of affects. Then nothing remains  but imaginary resemblances between terms, or symbolic analogies  between relations. This segment refers to the father, that relation of move-  ment and rest refers to the primal scene, etc. It must be recognized that psy-  choanalysis alone is not enough to bring about this breakage. It only brings  out a danger inherent in becoming. There is always the danger of finding  yourself "playing" the animal, the domestic Oedipal animal, Miller going  bowwow and taking a bone, Fitzgerald licking your hand, Slepian returning  to his mother, or the old man playing horse or dog on an erotic postcard  from 1900 (and "playing" at being a wild animal would be no better).  Becomings-animal continually run these dangers. *Memories of a Haecceity. *A body is not defined by the form that deter mines it nor as a determinate substance or subject nor by the organs it pos sesses or the functions it fulfills. On the plane of consistency, *a body is  defined only by a longitude and a latitude: *in other words the sum total of the material elements belonging to it under given relations of movement and rest, speed and slowness (longitude); the sum total of the intensive affects it is capable of at a given power or degree of potential (latitude). Nothing but affects and local movements, differential speeds. The credit goes to Spinoza for calling attention to these two dimensions of the Body,

There is a mode of individuation very different from that of a person, subject, thing, or substance. We reserve the name *haecceity *for it. 33 A sea son, a winter, a summer, an hour, a date have a perfect individuality lacking nothing, even though this individuality is different from that of a thing or a subject. They are haecceities in the sense that they consist entirely of rela tions of movement and rest between molecules or particles, capacities to affect and be affected. When demonology expounds upon the diabolical art of local movements and transports of affect, it also notes the impor tance of rain, hail, wind, pestilential air, or air polluted by noxious parti cles, favorable conditions for these transports. Tales must contain haecceities that are not simply emplacements, but concrete individuations that have a status of their own and direct the metamorphosis of things and subjects. Among types of civilizations, the Orient has many more individuations by haecceity than by subjectivity or substantiality: the haiku, for example, must include indicators as so many floating lines con stituting a complex individual. In Charlotte Bronte, everything is in terms of *wind, *things, people, faces, loves, words. Lorca's "five in the evening," when love falls and fascism rises. That awful five in the evening! We say, "What a story!" "What heat!" "What a life!" to designate a very singular individuation. The hours of the day in Lawrence, in Faulkner. A degree of heat, an intensity of white, are perfect individualities; and a degree of heat can combine in latitude with another degree to form a new individual, as in a body that is cold here and hot there depending on its longitude. Norwe gian omelette. A degree of heat can combine with an intensity of white, as in certain white skies of a hot summer. This is in no way an individuality of the instant, as opposed to the individuality of permanences or durations. A tear-off calendar has just as much time as a perpetual calendar, although the time in question is not the same. There are animals that live no longer than a day or an hour; conversely, a group of years can be as long as the most durable subject or object. We can conceive of an abstract time that is equal for haecceities and for subjects or things. Between the extreme slownesses and vertiginous speeds of geology and astronomy, Michel Tournier places meteorology, where meteors live at our pace: "A cloud forms in the sky like an image in my brain, the wind blows like I breathe, a rainbow spans the horizon for as long as my heart needs to reconcile itself to life, the summer passes like vacation drifts by." But is it by chance that in Tournier's novel this certitude can come only to a twin hero who is deformed and desubjectified, and has acquired a certain ubiquity? 34 Even when times are abstractly equal, the individuation of a life is not the same as the individuation of the subject that leads it or serves as its support.

And it is not in the same time, the same temporality. *Aeon: *the indefinite time of the event, the floating line that knows only speeds and continually divides that which transpires into an already-there that is at the same time not-yet-here, a simultaneous too-late and too-early, a something that is both going to happen and has just happened. *Chronos: *the time of measure that situates things and persons, develops a form, and determines a subject. 35 Boulez distinguishes tempo and nontempo in music: the "pulsed time" of a formal and functional music based on values versus the "nonpulsed time" of a floating music, both floating *and *machinic, which has nothing but speeds or differences in dynamic. 36 In short, the difference is not at all between the ephemeral and the durable, nor even between the regular and the irregular, but between two modes of individuation, two modes of temporality. We must avoid an oversimplified conciliation, as though there were on the one hand formed subjects, of the thing or person type, and on the other hand spatiotemporal coordinates of the haecceity type. For you will yield nothing to haecceities unless you realize that that is what you are, and that you are nothing but that. When the face becomes a haecceity: "It seemed a curious mixture that simply made do with time, weather and these peo ple." 37 You are longitude and latitude, a set of speeds and slownesses between unformed particles, a set of nonsubjectified affects. You have the individuality of a day, a season, a year, *a life *(regardless of its duration)—a climate, a wind, a fog, a swarm, a pack (regardless of its regularity). Or at least you can have it, you can reach it. A cloud of locusts carried in by the wind at five in the evening; a vampire who goes out at night, a werewolf at full moon. It should not be thought that a haecceity consists simply of a decor or backdrop that situates subjects, or of appendages that hold things and people to the ground. It is the entire assemblage in its individuated aggregate that is a haecceity; it is this assemblage that is defined by a longi tude and a latitude, by speeds and affects, independently of forms and sub jects, which belong to another plane. It is the wolf itself, and the horse, and the child, that cease to be subjects to become events, in assemblages that are inseparable from an hour, a season, an atmosphere, an air, a life. The street enters into composition with the horse, just as the dying rat enters into composition with the air, and the beast and the full moon enter into composition with each other. At most, we may distinguish assemblage haecceities (a body considered only as longitude and latitude) and interassemblage haecceities, which also mark the potentialities of becom ing within each assemblage (the milieu of intersection of the longitudes

Climate, wind, season, hour are not of another nature than the things, animals, or people that pop ulate them, follow them, sleep and awaken within them. This should be read without a pause: the animal-stalks-at-five-o'clock. The becoming-evening, becoming-night of an animal, blood nuptials. Five o'clock is this animal! This animal is this place! "The thin dog is running in the road, this dog is the road," cries Virginia Woolf. That is how we need to feel. Spatiotemporal relations, determinations, are not predicates of the thing but dimensions of multiplicities. The street is as much a part of the omnibus-horse assemblage as the Hans assemblage the becoming-horse of which it initiates. We are all five o'clock in the evening, or another hour, or rather two hours simultaneously, the optimal and the pessimal, noon-midnight, but distributed in a variable fashion. The plane of consistency contains only haecceities, along intersecting lines. Forms and subjects are not of that world. Virginia Woolf s walk through the crowd, among the taxis. Taking a walk is a haecceity; never again will Mrs. Dalloway say to herself, "I am this, I am that, he is this, he is that." And "She felt very young; at the same time unspeakably aged. She sliced like a knife through everything; at the same time was outside, looking on.... She always had the feeling that it was very, very dangerous to live even one day." 38 Haecceity, fog, glare. A haecceity has neither beginning nor end, origin nor destination; it is always in the middle. It is not made of points, only of lines. It is a rhizome. And it is not the same language, at least not the same usage of language. For if the plane of consistency only has haecceities for content, it also has its own particular semiotic to serve as expression. A plane of content and a plane of expression. This semiotic is composed above all of proper names, verbs in the infinitive and indefinite articles or pronouns. *Indefinite article  + proper name *+ *infinitive verb *constitutes the basic chain of expression, correlative to the least formalized contents, from the standpoint of a semiotic that has freed itself from both formal signifiances and personal subjectifications. In the first place, the verb in the infinitive is in no way indeterminate with respect to time; it expresses the floating, nonpulsed time proper to Aeon, in other words, the time of the pure event or of becom ing, which articulates relative speeds and slownesses independently of the chronometric or chronological values that time assumes in the other modes. There is good reason to oppose the infinitive as mode and tense of becoming to all of the other modes and tenses, which pertain to Chronos since they form pulsations or values of being (the verb "to be" is precisely the only one that has no infinitive, or rather the infinitive of which is only an indeterminate, empty expression, taken abstractly to designate the sum total of definite modes and tenses). 39 Second, the proper name is no way

The proper name fundamentally designates something that is of the order of the event, of becoming or of the haecceity. It is the military men and meteo rologists who hold the secret of proper names, when they give them to a strategic operation or a hurricane. The proper name is not the subject of a tense but the agent of an infinitive. It marks a longitude and a latitude. If Tick, Wolf, Horse, etc., are true proper names, they are so not by virtue of the specific and generic denominators that characterize them but of the speeds that compose them and the affects that fill them; it is by virtue of the event they are in themselves and in the assemblages—the becoming-horse of Little Hans, the becoming-wolf of the Were [which etymologically means "man"—Trans.], the becoming-tick of the Stoic (other proper names). Third, the indefinite article and the indefinite pronoun are no more indeterminate than the infinitive. Or rather they are lacking a determina tion only insofar as they are applied to a form that is itself indeterminate, or to a determinable subject. On the other hand, they lack nothing when they introduce haecceities, events, the individuation of which does not pass into a form and is not effected by a subject. The indefinite then has maximum determination: once upon a time; a child is being beaten; a horse is falling ... Here, the elements in play find their individuation in the assemblage of which they are a part, independent of the form of their con cept and the subjectivity of their person. We have remarked several times the extent to which children use the indefinite not as something indetermi nate but, on the contrary, as an individuating function within a collectivity. That is why we are dumbfounded by the efforts of psychoanalysis, which desperately wants there to be something definite hidden behind the indefi nite, a possessive, a person. When the child says "a belly," "a horse," "how do *people *grow up?" *"someone *is beating *a *child," the psychoanalyst hears "my belly," "the father," "will I grow up to be like daddy?" The psychoana lyst asks: Who is being beaten, and by whom? 41 Even linguistics is not immune from the same prejudice, inasmuch as it is inseparable from a personology; according to linguistics, in addition to the indefinite -article and the pronoun, the third-person pronoun also lacks the determination of subjectivity that is proper to the first two persons and is supposedly the necessary condition for all enunciation. 42 We believe on the contrary that the third person indefinite, HE , THEY ,

1730: BECOMING-INTENSE, BECOMING-ANIMAL ... D 265 implies no indetermination from this point of view; it ties the statement to a collective assemblage, as its necessary condition, rather than to a subject of the enunciation. Blanchot is correct in saying that ONE and HE —*one *is dying, *he *is unhappy—in no way take the place of a subject, but instead do away with any subject in favor of an assemblage of the haecceity type that carries or brings out the event insofar as it is unformed and incapable of being effectuated by persons ("something happens to them that they can only get a grip on again by letting go of their ability to say I"). 43 The HE does not represent a subject but rather makes a diagram of an assemblage. It does not overcode statements, it does not transcend them as do the first two persons; on the contrary, it prevents them from falling under the tyr anny of subjective or signifying constellations, under the regime of empty redundancies. The contents of the chains of expression it articulates are those that can be assembled for a maximum number of occurrences and becomings. "They arrive like fate... where do they come from, how have they pushed this far .. .?" 44 He or one, indefinite article, proper name, infinitive verb: A HANS TO BECOME HORSE , A PACK NAMED WOLF TO LOOK AT HE, ONE TO DIE, WASP TO MEET ORCHID, THEY ARRIVE HUNS. Classified ads, telegraphic machines on the plane of consistency (once again, we are reminded of the procedures of Chinese poetry and the rules for translation suggested by the best commentators). 45 *Memories of a Plan(e) Maker. *Perhaps there are two planes, or two ways of conceptualizing the plane. The plane can be a hidden principle, which makes visible what is seen and audible what is heard, etc., which at every instant causes the given to be given, in this or that state, at this or that moment. But the plane itself is not given. It is by nature hidden. It can only be inferred, induced, concluded from that to which it gives rise (simultane ously or successively, synchronically or diachronically). A plane of this kind is as much a plan(e) of organization as of development: it is structural or genetic, and both at once, structure and genesis, the structural plan(e) of formed organizations with their developments, the genetic plan(e) of evo lutionary developments with their organizations. These are only nuances of this first conception of the plane. To accord these nuances too much importance would prevent us from grasping something more important; that the plan(e), conceived or made in this fashion, always concerns the development of forms and the formation of subjects. A hidden structure necessary for forms, a secret signifier necessary for subjects. It ensues that the plan(e) itself will not be given. It exists only in a supplementary dimen sion to that to which it gives rise *(n +*1). This makes it a teleological plan(e), a design, a mental principle. It is a plan(e) of transcendence. It is a plan(e) of analogy, either because it assigns the eminent term of a development or

It may be in the mind of a god, or in the unconscious of life, of the soul, or of language: it is always concluded from its own effects. It is always inferred. *Even if it is  said to be immanent, *it is so only by absence, analogically (metaphorically, metonymically, etc.). The tree is given in the seed, but as a function of a plan(e) that is not given. The same applies to music. The developmental or organizational principle does not appear in itself, in a direct relation with that which develops or is organized: There is a transcendent compositional principle that is not of the nature of sound, that is not "audible" by itself or for itself. This opens the way for all possible interpretations. Forms and their developments, and subjects and their formations, relate to a plan(e) that operates as a transcendent unity or hidden principle. The plan(e) can always be described, but as a part aside, as ungiven in that to which it gives rise. Is this not how even Balzac, even Proust, describe their work's plan(e) of organization or development, as though in a metalanguage? Is not Stockhausen also obliged to describe the structure of his sound forms as existing "alongside" them, since he is unable to make it audible? Life plan(e), music plan(e), writing plan(e), it's all the same: a plan(e) that can not be given as such, that can only be inferred from the forms it develops and the subjects it forms, since it *is for *these forms and these subjects. Then there is an altogether different plane, or an altogether different conception of the plane. Here, there are no longer any forms or develop ments of forms; nor are there subjects or the formation of subjects. There is no structure, any more than there is genesis. There are only relations of movement and rest, speed and slowness between unformed elements, or at least between elements that are relatively unformed, molecules and particles of all kinds. There are only haecceities, affects, subjectless indi viduations that constitute collective assemblages. Nothing develops, but things arrive late or early, and form this or that assemblage depending on their compositions of speed. Nothing subjectifies, but haecceities form according to compositions of nonsubjectified powers or affects. We call this plane, which knows only longitudes and latitudes, speeds and haec ceities, the plane of consistency or composition (as opposed to the plan(e) of organization or development). It is necessarily a plane of immanence and univocality. We therefore call it the plane of Nature, although nature has nothing to do with it, since on this plane there is no distinction between the natural and the artificial. However many dimensions it may have, it never has a supplementary dimension to that which transpires upon it. That alone makes it natural and immanent. The same goes for the principle of contradiction: this plane could also be called the plane of noncontradiction. The plane of consistency could be called the plane of nonconsistency. It is a geometrical plane, no longer tied to a mental design

It is thus a plane of proliferation, peopling, contagion; but this proliferation of material has nothing to do with an evolution, the development of a form or the filiation of forms. Still less is it a regression leading back to a principle. It is on the contrary an *involution, *in which form is constantly being dis solved, freeing times and speeds. It is a fixed plane, a fixed sound plane, or visual plane, or writing plane, etc. Here, fixed does not mean immobile: it is the absolute state of movement as well as of rest, from which all relative speeds and slownesses spring, and nothing but them. Certain modern musicians oppose the transcendent plan(e) of organization, which is said to have dominated all of Western classical music, to the immanent sound plane, which is always given along with that to which it gives rise, brings the imperceptible to perception, and carries only differential speeds and slownesses in a kind of molecular lapping: *the work of art must mark sec-  onds, tenths and hundredths of seconds.* *46* * *Or rather it is a question of a free ing of time, Aeon, a nonpulsed time for a floating music, as Boulez says, an electronic music in which forms are replaced by pure modifications of speed. It is undoubtedly John Cage who first and most perfectly deployed this fixed sound plane, which affirms a process against all structure and genesis, a floating time against pulsed time or tempo, experimentation against any kind of interpretation, and in which silence as sonorous rest also marks the absolute state of movement. The same could be said of the fixed visual plane: Godard, for example, effectively carries the fixed plane of cinema to this state where forms dissolve, and all that subsists are tiny variations of speed between movements in composition. Nathalie Sarraute, for her part, proposes a clear distinction between two planes of writing: a transcendent plan(e) that organizes and develops forms (genres, themes, motifs) and assigns and develops subjects (personages, characters, feelings); and an altogether different plane that liberates the particles of an anonymous matter, allowing them to communicate through the "enve lope" of forms and subjects, retaining between them only relations of movement and rest, speed and slowness, floating affects, so that the plane itself is perceived at the same time as it allows us to perceive the impercep tible (the microplane, the molecular plane). 47 So from the point of view of a well-founded abstraction, we can make it seem as though the two planes, the two conceptions of the plane, were in clear and absolute opposition. From this point of view, we can say, You can see the difference between the following two types of propositions: (1) forms develop and subjects form as a function of a plan(e) that can only be inferred (the planfe] of organi zation-development); (2) there are only speeds and slownesses between unformed elements, and affects between nonsubjectified powers, as a func

First, Holderlin's extraordinary composition, *Hyperion, *as analyzed by Robert Rovini: the importance of haecceities of the season type. These constitute, in two different ways, the "frame of the narrative" (plan[e]) and the details of what happens within that frame (the assemblages and interassemblages). 49 He also notes how the succession of the seasons and the superposition of the same season from different years dissolves forms and persons and gives rise to movements, speeds, delays, and affects, as if as the narrative progressed something were escaping from an impalpable matter. And perhaps also the relation to a "realpolitik," to a war machine, to a musical machine of dissonance. Kleist: everything with him, in his writing as in his life, becomes speed and slowness. A succession of catatonic freezes and extreme velocities, fainting spells and shooting arrows. Sleep on your steed, then take off at a gallop. Jump from one assemblage to another, with the aid of a faint, by crossing a void. Kleist multiplies "life plan(e)s," but his voids and failures, his leaps, earthquakes, and plagues are always included on a single plane. The plane is not a principle of organization but a means of transportation. No form develops, no subject forms; affects are displaced, becomings cata pult forward and combine into blocks, like the becoming-woman of Achil les and the becoming-dog of Penthesilea. Kleist offers a wonderful explanation of how forms and persons are only appearances produced by the displacement of a center of gravity on an abstract line, and by the con junction of these lines on a plane of immanence. He is fascinated by bears; they are impossible to fool because their cruel little eyes see through appearances to the true "soul of movement," the *Gemut *or nonsubjective affect: the becoming-bear of Kleist. Even death can only be conceptualized as the intersection of elementary reactions of different speeds. *A skull  exploding, *one of Kleist's obsessions. All of Kleist's work is traversed by a war machine invoked against the State, by a musical machine invoked against painting or the "picture." It is odd how Goethe and Hegel hated this new kind of writing. Because for them the plan(e) must indissolubly be a harmonious development of Form and a regulated formation of the Sub ject, personage, or character (the sentimental education, the interior and substantial solidity of the character, the harmony or analogy of the forms and continuity of development, the cult of the State, etc.). Their concep tion of the Plane is totally opposed to that of Kleist. The anti-Goetheism, anti-Hegelianism of Kleist, and already of Holderlin. Goethe gets to the crux of the matter when he reproaches Kleist for simultaneously setting up a pure "stationary process" that is like the fixed plane, introducing voids

1730: BECOMING-INTENSE, BECOMING-ANIMAL ... □ 269 and jumps that prevent any development of a central character, and mobi lizing a violence of affects that causes an extreme confusion of feelings. 50 Nietzsche does the same thing by different means. There is no longer any development of forms or formation of subjects. He criticizes Wagner for retaining too much harmonic form, and too many pedagogical person ages, or "characters": too much Hegel and Goethe. Now Bizet, on the other hand, Nietzsche says ... It seems to us that fragmentary writing is not so much the issue in Nietzsche. It is instead speeds and slownesses: not writ ing slowly or rapidly, but rather writing, and everything else besides, as a production of speeds and slownesses between particles. No form will resist that, no character or subject will survive it. Zarathustra is only speeds and slownesses, and the eternal return, the life of the eternal return, is the first great concrete freeing of nonpulsed time. *Ecce Homo *has only individ uations by haecceities. It is inevitable that the Plan(e), thus conceived, will always fail, but that the failures will be an integral part of the plan(e): See the multitude of plans for *The Will to Power. *For a given aphorism, it is always possible, even necessary, to introduce new relations of speed and slowness between its elements that truly make it change assemblages, jump from one assemblage to the next (the issue is therefore not the fragment). As Cage says, it is of the nature of the plan(e) that it fail. 51 Precisely because it is not a plan(e) of organization, development, or formation, but of nonvoluntary transmutation. Or Boulez: "Program the machine so that each time a tape is played on it, it produces different time characteristics." So the plan(e)—life plan(e), writing plan(e), music plan(e)—must neces sarily fail for it is impossible to be faithful to it; but the failures are a part of the plan(e) for the plan(e) expands or shrinks along with the dimensions of that which it deploys in each instance (planitude of *n *dimensions). A strange machine that is simultaneously a machine of war, music, and contagion-proliferation-involution. Why does the opposition between the two kinds of planes lead to a still more abstract hypothesis? Because one continually passes from one to the other, by unnoticeable degrees and without being aware of it, or one be comes aware of it only afterward. Because one continually reconstitutes one plane atop another, or extricates one from the other. For example, all we need to do is to sink the floating plane of immanence, bury it in the depths of Nature instead of allowing it to play freely on the surface, for it to pass to the other side and assume the role of a ground that can no longer be anything more than a principle of analogy from the standpoint of organiza tion, and a law of continuity from the standpoint of development. 52 The plane of organization or development effectively covers what we have called stratification: Forms and subjects, organs and functions, are "strata" or relations between strata.

The plane of consistency is the body without organs. Pure relations of speed and slowness between particles imply movements of deterritorialization, just as pure affects imply an enterprise of desubjectification. Moreover, the plane of consistency does not preexist the movements of deterritorialization that unravel it, the lines of flight that draw it and cause it to rise to the surface, the becomings that compose it. The plane of organization is constantly working away at the plane of consistency, always trying to plug the lines of flight, stop or inter rupt the movements of deterritorialization, weigh them down, restratify them, reconstitute forms and subjects in a dimension of depth. Conversely, the plane of consistency is constantly extricating itself from the plane of organization, causing particles to spin off the strata, scrambling forms by dint of speed or slowness, breaking down functions by means of assem blages or microassemblages. But once again, so much caution is needed to prevent the plane of consistency from becoming a pure plane of abolition or death, to prevent the involution from turning into a regression to the undifferentiated. Is it not necessary to retain a minimum of strata, a mini mum of forms and functions, a minimal subject from which to extract materials, affects, and assemblages? In fact, the opposition we should set up between the two planes is that between two abstract poles: for example, to the transcendent, organiza tional plane of Western music based on sound forms and their develop ment, we oppose the immanent plane of consistency of Eastern music, composed of speeds and slownesses, movements and rest. In keeping with our concrete hypothesis, the whole becoming of Western music, all musical becoming, implies a minimum of sound forms and even of melodic and harmonic functions; speeds and slownesses are made to pass across them, and it is precisely these speeds and slownesses that reduce the forms and functions to the minimum. Beethoven produced the most astonishing polyphonic richness with relatively scanty themes of three or four notes. There is a material proliferation that goes hand in hand with a dissolution of form (involution) but is at the same time accompanied by a continuous development of form. Perhaps Schumann's genius is the most striking case of form being developed only for the relations of speed and slowness one materially and emotionally assigns it. Music has always submitted its forms and motifs to temporal transformations, augmentations or diminu tions, slowdowns or accelerations, which do not occur solely according to laws of organization or even of development. Expanding and contracting microintervals are at play within coded intervals. Wagner and the post-Wagnerians free variations of speed between sound particles to an even greater extent. Ravel and Debussy retain just enough form to shatter it,

Boulez speaks of proliferations of little motifs, accumulations of little notes that proceed kinematically and affectively, sweeping away a simple form by adding indi cations of speed to it; this allows one to produce extremely complex dynamic relations on the basis of intrinsically simple formal relations. Even a rubato by Chopin cannot be reproduced because it will have differ ent time characteristics at each playing. 53 It is as though an immense plane of consistency of variable speed were forever sweeping up forms and func tions, forms and subjects, extracting from them particles and affects. A clock keeping a whole assortment of times. What is a girl, what is a group of girls? Proust at least has shown us once and for all that their individuation, collective or singular, proceeds not by subjectivity but by haecceity, pure haecceity. "Fugitive beings." They are pure relations of speeds and slownesses, and nothing else. A girl is late on account of her speed: she did too many things, crossed too many spaces in relation to the relative time of the person waiting for her. Thus her apparent slowness is transformed into the breakneck speed of our waiting. It must be said in this connection, and for the whole of the *Recherche du temps perdu, * that Swann does not at all occupy the same position as the narrator. Swann is not a rough sketch or precursor of the narrator, except secondarily and at rare moments. They are not at all on the same *plane. *Swann is always think ing and feeling in terms of subjects, forms, resemblances between subjects, and correspondences between forms. For him, one of Odette's lies is a form whose secret subjective content must be discovered, provoking amateur detective activity. To him Vinteuil's music is a form that must evoke some thing else, fall back on something else, echo other forms, whether paint ings, faces, or landscapes. Although the narrator may follow in Swann's footsteps, he is nonetheless in a different element, on a different plane. One of Albertine's lies is nearly devoid of content; it tends on the contrary to merge with the emission of a particle issuing from the eyes of the beloved, a particle that stands only for itself and travels too fast through the narrator's auditory or visual field. This molecular speed is unbearable because it indicates a distance, a *proximity *where Albertine would like to be, and already is. 54 So that the narrator's pose is not principally that of the investi gating detective but (a very different figure) that of the jailer. How can he become master of speed, how can he stand it nervously (as a headache) and perceptually (as a flash)? How can he build a prison for Albertine? Jealousy is different in Swann and the narrator, as is the perception of music: Vinteuil gradually ceases to be apprehended in terms of forms and compa rable subjects, and assumes incredible speeds and slownesses that combine

It is as though Swann's desperate efforts to reterritorialize the flow of things (to reterritorialize Odette on a secret, painting on a face, music on the Bois de Boulogne) were replaced by the sped-up movement of deterritorialization, by a linear speedup of the abstract machine, sweeping away faces and landscapes, and then love, jeal ousy, painting, and music itself, according to increasingly stronger coeffi cients that nourish the Work at risk of dissolving everything and dying. For the narrator, despite partial victories, fails in his project; that project was not at all to regain time or to force back memories, but to become master of speeds to the rhythm of his asthma. It was to face annihilation. But another outcome was possible, or was made possible by Proust. ***Memories of a Molecule. ***Becoming-animal is only one becoming among others. A kind of order or apparent progression can be established for the segments of becoming in which we find ourselves; becoming-woman, becoming-child; becoming-animal, -vegetable, or -mineral; becomings-molecular of all kinds, becomings-particles. Fibers lead us from one to the other, transform one into the other as they pass through doors and across thresholds. Singing or composing, painting, writing have no other aim: to unleash these becomings. Especially music; music is traversed by a becoming-woman, becoming-child, and not only at the level of themes and motifs: the little refrain, children's games and dances, childhood scenes. Instrumentation and orchestration are permeated by becomings-animal, above all becomings-bird, but many others besides. The lapping, wailing of molecular discordances have always been present, even if instrumental evolution with other factors is now giving them growing importance, as the value of a new threshold for a properly musical content: the sound molecule, relations of speed and slowness between particles. Becomings-animal plunge into becomings-molecular. This raises all kinds of questions. In a way, we must start at the end: all becomings are already molecular. That is because becoming is not to imitate or identify with something or someone. Nor is it to proportion formal relations. Neither of these two fig ures of analogy is applicable to becoming: neither the imitation of a subject nor the proportionality of a form. Starting from the forms one has, the sub ject one is, the organs one has, or the functions one fulfills, becoming is to extract particles between which one establishes the relations of movement and rest, speed and slowness that are *closest *to what one is becoming, and through which one becomes. This is the sense in which becoming is the process of desire. This principle of proximity or approximation is entirely particular and reintroduces no analogy whatsoever. It indicates as rigor

Louis Wolfson embarks upon a strange undertaking: a schizophrenic, he translates as quickly as possible each phrase in his maternal language into foreign words with similar sound and meaning; an anorexic, he rushes to the refrigerator, tears open the packages and snatches their contents, stuffing himself as quickly as possible. 56 It would be false to believe that he needs to borrow "disguised" words from foreign languages. Rather, he snatches from his own language verbal particles that can no longer belong to the form of that language, just as he snatches from food alimentary particles that no longer act as formed nutritional substances; the two kinds of particles enter into proximity. We could also put it this way: Becoming is to emit particles that take on certain relations of movement and rest because they enter a partic ular zone of proximity. Or, it is to emit particles that enter that zone because they take on those relations. A haecceity is inseparable from the fog and mist that depend on a molecular zone, a corpuscular space. Prox imity is a notion, at once topological and quantal, that marks a belonging to the same molecule, independently of the subjects considered and the forms determined. Scherer and Hocquenghem made this essential point in their reconsid eration of the problem of wolf-children. Of course, it is not a question of a real production, as if the child "really" became an animal; nor is it a ques tion of a resemblance, as if the child imitated animals that really raised it; nor is it a question of a symbolic metaphor, as if the autistic child that was abandoned or lost merely became the "analogue" of an animal. Scherer and Hocquenghem are right to expose this false reasoning, which is based on a culturalism or moralism upholding the irreducibility of the human order: Because the child has not been transformed into an animal, it must only have a metaphorical relation to it, induced by the child's illness or rejection. For their own part, they appeal to an objective zone of indetermi-nation or uncertainty, "something shared or indiscernible," a proximity "that makes it impossible to say where the boundary between the human and animal lies," not only in the case of autistic children, but for all children; it is as though, independent of the evolution carrying them toward adulthood, there were room in the child for other becomings, "other contemporaneous possibilities" that are not regressions but creative involutions bearing witness to *"an inhumanity  immediately experienced in the body as such," *unnatural nuptials "outside the programmed body." There is a reality of becoming-animal, even though one does not in reality become animal. It is useless, then, to raise the objection that the dog-child only plays dog within the limits of his formal constitution, and does nothing canine that another human being could not have done if he or she had so

For what needs to be explained is precisely the fact that all chil dren, and even many adults, do it to a greater or lesser degree, and in so doing bear witness to an inhuman connivance with the animal, rather than an Oedipal symbolic community. 57 Neither should it be thought that chil dren who graze, or eat dirt or raw flesh, are merely getting the vitamins and minerals they need. It is a question of composing a body with the animal, a body without organs defined by zones of intensity or proximity. Where does this objective indetermination or indiscernibility of which Scherer and Hocquenghem speak come from? An example: Do not imitate a dog, but make your organism enter into composition with *something else *in such a way that the particles emitted from the aggregate thus composed will be canine as a function of the rela tion of movement and rest, or of molecular proximity, into which they enter. Clearly, this something else can be quite varied, and be more or less directly related to the animal in question: it can be the animal's natural food (dirt and worm), or its exterior relations with other animals (you can become-dog with cats, or become-monkey with a horse), or an apparatus or prosthesis to which a person subjects the animal (muzzle and reindeer, etc.), or something that does not even have a localizable relation to the ani mal in question. For this last case, we have seen how Slepian bases his attempt to become-dog on the idea of tying shoes to his hands using his mouth-muzzle. Philippe Gavi cites the performances of Lolito, an eater of bottles, earthenware, porcelains, iron, and even bicycles, who declares: "I consider myself half-animal, half-man. More animal than man. I love ani mals, dogs especially, I feel a bond with them. My teeth have adapted; in fact, when I don't eat glass or iron, my jaw aches like a young dog's that craves to chew a bone." 58 If we interpret the word "like" as a metaphor, or propose a structural analogy of relations (man-iron = dog-bone), we under stand nothing of becoming. The word "like" is one of those words that change drastically in meaning and function when they are used in connec tion with haecceities, when they are made into expressions of becomings instead of signified states or signifying relations. A dog may exercise its jaw on iron, but when it does it is using its jaw as a molar organ. When Lolito eats iron, it is totally different: he makes his jaw enter into composition with the iron in such a way that he himself becomes the jaw of a molecular dog. The actor Robert De Niro walks "like" a crab in a certain film sequence; but, he says, it is not a question of his imitating a crab; it is a ques tion of making something that has to do with the crab enter into composi tion with the image, with the speed of the image. 59 That is the essential point for us: you become-animal only if, by whatever means or elements, you emit corpuscles that enter the relation of movement and rest of the ani mal particles, or what amounts to the same thing, that enter the zone of

You do not become a barking molar dog, but by barking, if it is done with enough feeling, with enough necessity and composition, you emit a molec ular dog. Man does not become wolf, or vampire, as if he changed molar species; the vampire and werewolf are becomings of man, in other words, proximities between molecules in composition, relations of movement and rest, speed and slowness between emitted particles. Of course there are werewolves and vampires, we say this with all our heart; but do not look for a resemblance or analogy to the animal, for this is becoming-animal in action, the production of the molecular animal (whereas the "real" animal is trapped in its molar form and subjectivity). It is within us that the animal bares its teeth like Hofmannsthal's rat, or the flower opens its petals; but this is done by corpuscular emission, by molecular proximity, and not by the imitation of a subject or a proportionality of form. Albertine can always imitate a flower, but it is when she is sleeping and enters into composition with the particles of sleep that her beauty spot and the texture of her skin enter a relation of rest and movement that place her in the zone of a molec ular vegetable: the becoming-plant of Albertine. And it is when she is held prisoner that she emits the particles of a bird. And it is when she flees, launches down a line of flight, that she becomes-horse, even if it is the horse of death. Yes, all becomings are molecular: the animal, flower, or stone one becomes are molecular collectivities, haecceities, not molar subjects, objects, or form that we know from the outside and recognize from experi ence, through science, or by habit. If this is true, then we must say the same of things human: there is a becoming-woman, a becoming-child, that do not resemble the woman or the child as clearly distinct molar entities (al though it is possible—only possible—for the woman or child to occupy privileged positions in relation to these becomings). What we term a molar entity is, for example, the woman as defined by her form, endowed with organs and functions and assigned as a subject. Becoming-woman is not imitating this entity or even transforming oneself into it. We are not, how ever, overlooking the importance of imitation, or moments of imitation, among certain homosexual males, much less the prodigious attempt at a real transformation on the part of certain transvestites. All we are saying is that these indissociable aspects of becoming-woman must first be under stood as a function of something else: not imitating or assuming the female form, but emitting particles that enter the relation of movement and rest, or the zone of proximity, of a microfemininity, in other words, that produce in us a molecular woman, create the molecular woman. We do not mean to say that a creation of this kind is the prerogative of the man, but on the con trary that the woman as a molar entity *has to become-woman *in order that

It is, of course, indispensa ble for women to conduct a molar politics, with a view to winning back their own organism, their own history, their own subjectivity: "we as women .. ." makes its appearance as a subject of enunciation. But it is dan gerous to confine oneself to such a subject, which does not function with out drying up a spring or stopping a flow. The song of life is often intoned by the driest of women, moved by *ressentiment, *the will to power and cold mothering. Just as a dessicated child makes a much better child, there being no childhood flow emanating from it any longer. It is no more ade quate to say that each sex contains the other and must develop the opposite pole in itself. Bisexuality is no better a concept than the separateness of the sexes. It is as deplorable to miniaturize, internalize the binary machine as it is to exacerbate it; it does not extricate us from it. It is thus necessary to conceive of a molecular women's politics that slips into molar confronta tions, and passes under or through them. When Virginia Woolf was questioned about a specifically women's writ ing, she was appalled at the idea of writing "as a woman." Rather, writing should produce a becoming-woman as atoms of womanhood capable of crossing and impregnating an entire social field, and of contaminating men, of sweeping them up in that becoming. Very soft particles—but also very hard and obstinate, irreducible, indomitable. The rise of women in English novel writing has spared no man: even those who pass for the most virile, the most phallocratic, such as Lawrence and Miller, in their turn continually tap into and emit particles that enter the proximity or zone of indiscernibility of women. In writing, they become-women. The question is not, or not only, that of the organism, history, and subject of enunciation that oppose masculine to feminine in the great dualism machines. The question is fundamentally that of the body—the body they *steal *from us in order to fabricate opposable organisms. This body is stolen first from the girl: Stop behaving like that, you're not a little girl anymore, you're not a tomboy, etc. The girl's becoming is stolen first, in order to impose a history, or prehistory, upon her. The boy's turn comes next, but it is by using the girl as an example, by pointing to the girl as the object of his desire, that an opposed organism, a dominant history is fabricated for him too. The girl is the first victim, but she must also serve as an example and a trap. That is why, conversely, the reconstruction of the body as a Body without Organs, the anorganism of the body, is inseparable from a becoming-woman, or the production of a molecular woman. Doubtless, the girl becomes a woman in the molar or organic sense. But conversely, becoming-woman or the molec ular woman is the girl herself. The girl is certainly not defined by virginity; she is defined by a relation of movement and rest, speed and slowness, by a combination of atoms, an emission of particles: haecceity. She never ceases

Thus girls do not belong to an age group, sex, order, or kingdom: they slip in everywhere, between orders, acts, ages, sexes; they produce *n *molec ular sexes on the line of flight in relation to the dualism machines they cross right through. The only way to get outside the dualisms is to be-between, to pass between, the intermezzo—that is what Virginia Woolf lived with all her energies, in all of her work, never ceasing to become. The girl is like the block of becoming that remains contemporaneous to each opposable term, man, woman, child, adult. It is not the girl who becomes a woman; it is becoming-woman that produces the universal girl. Trost, a mysterious author, painted a portrait of the girl, to whom he linked the fate of the revo lution: her speed, her freely machinic body, her intensities, her abstract line or line of flight, her molecular production, her indifference to mem ory, her nonfigurative character—"the nonfigurative of desire." 60 Joan of Arc? The special role of the girl in Russian terrorism: the girl with the bomb, guardian of dynamite? It is certain that molecular politics proceeds via the girl and the child. But it is also certain that girls and children draw their strength neither from the molar status that subdues them nor from the organism and subjectivity they receive; they draw their strength from the becoming-molecular they cause to pass between sexes and ages, the becoming-child of the adult as well as of the child, the becoming-woman of the man as well as of the woman. The girl and the child do not become; it is becoming itself that is a child or a girl. The child does not become an adult any more than the girl becomes a woman; the girl is the becoming-woman of each sex, just as the child is the becoming-young of every age. Knowing how to age does not mean remaining young; it means extracting from one's age the particles, the speeds and slownesses, the flows that constitute the youth *of that *age. Knowing how to love does not mean remaining a man or a woman; it means extracting from one's sex the particles, the speeds and slownesses, the flows, the *n *sexes that constitute the girl *of that *sexuality. It is Age itself that is a becoming-child, just as Sexuality, any sexuality, is a becoming-woman, in other words, a girl. This by way of response to the stu pid question, Why did Proust make Albert Albertine? Although all becomings are already molecular, including becoming-woman, it must be said that all becomings begin with and pass through becoming-woman. It is the key to all the other becomings. When the man of war disguises himself as a woman, flees disguised as a girl, hides as a girl, it is not a shameful, transitory incident in his life. To hide, to camouflage oneself, is a warrior function, and the line of flight attracts the enemy, traverses something and puts what it traverses to flight; the warrior arises in the infinity of a line of flight. Although the femininity of the man of war is not accidental, it should not be thought of as structural, or regulated by a

It is difficult to see how the correspondence between the two relations "man-war" and "woman-marriage" could entail an equivalence between the warrior and the girl as a woman who refuses to marry. 61 It is just as difficult to see how the general bisexuality, or even homosexuality, of military societies could explain this phenomenon, which is no more imitative than it is structural, representing instead an essential *anomie *of the man of war. This phenomenon can only be under stood in terms of becoming. We have seen how the man of war, by virtue of  *his furor *and celerity, was swept up in irresistible becomings-animal. These are becomings that have as their necessary condition the becoming-woman of the warrior, or his alliance with the girl, his contagion with her. The man of war is inseparable from the Amazons. The union of the girl and the man of war does not produce animals, but simultaneously produces the becoming-woman of the latter and the becoming-animal of the former, in a single "block" in which the warrior in turn becomes animal by contagion with the girl at the same time as the girl becomes warrior by contagion with the animal. Everything ties together in an asymmetrical block of becom ing, an instantaneous zigzag. It is in the vestiges of a double war machine— that of the Greeks, soon to be supplanted by the State, and that of the Amazons, soon to be dissolved—that Achilles and Penthesilea, the last man of war and the last queen of the girls, choose one another, Achilles in a becoming-woman, Penthesilea in a becoming-dog. The rites of transvestism or female impersonation in primitive societies in which a man becomes a woman are not explainable by a social organiza tion that places the given relations in correspondence, or by a psychic organization that makes the woman desire to become a man just as the man desires to become a woman. 62 Social structure and psychic identification leave too many special factors unaccounted for: the linkage, unleashing, and communication of the becomings triggered by the transvestite; the power *(puissance) *of the resultant becoming-animal; and above all the par ticipation of these becomings in a specific war machine. The same applies for sexuality: it is badly explained by the binary organization of the sexes, and just as badly by a bisexual organization within each sex. Sexuality brings into play too great a diversity of conjugated becomings; these are like *n *sexes, an entire war machine through which love passes. This is not a return to those appalling metaphors of love and war, seduction and con quest, the battle of the sexes and the domestic squabble, or even the Strindberg-war: it is only after love is done with and sexuality has dried up that things appear this way. What counts is that love itself is a war machine endowed with strange and somewhat terrifying powers. Sexuality is the production of a thousand sexes, which are so many uncontrollable becom ings. *Sexuality proceeds by way of the becoming-woman of the man and the*

There is no need for bestialism in this, although it may arise, and many psychiatric anec dotes document it in ways that are interesting, if oversimplified and conse quently off the track, too beastly. It is not a question of "playing" the dog, like an elderly gentleman on a postcard; it is not so much a question of mak ing love with animals. Becomings-animal are basically of another power, since their reality resides not in an animal one imitates or to which one cor responds but in themselves, in that which suddenly sweeps us up and makes us become—a *proximity, an indiscernibility *that extracts a shared element from the animal far more effectively than any domestication, uti lization, or imitation could: "the Beast." If becoming-woman is the first quantum, or molecular segment, with the becomings-animal that link up with it coming next, what are they all rushing toward? Without a doubt, toward becoming-imperceptible. The imperceptible is the immanent end of becoming, its cosmic formula. For example, Matheson's *Shrinking Man *passes through the kingdoms of nature, slips between molecules, to become an unfindable particle in infi nite meditation on the infinite. Paul Morand's *Monsieur Zero *flees the larger countries, crosses the smallest ones, descends the scale of States, establishes an anonymous society in Lichtenstein of which he is the only member, and dies imperceptible, forming the particle 0 with his fingers: "I am a man who flees by swimming under water, and at whom all the world's rifles fire. ... I must no longer offer a target." But what does becoming-imperceptible signify, coming at the end of all the molecular becomings that begin with becoming-woman? Becoming-imperceptible means many things. What is the relation between the (anorganic) imperceptible, the (asignifying) indiscernible, and the (asubjective) impersonal? A first response would be: to be like everybody else. That is what Kierkegaard relates in his story about the "knight of the faith," the man of becoming: to look at him, one would notice nothing, a bourgeois, nothing but a bourgeois. That is how Fitzgerald lived: after a real rupture, one suc ceeds ... in being just like everybody else. To go unnoticed is by no means easy. To be a stranger, even to one's doorman or neighbors. If it is so diffi cult to be "like" everybody else, it is because it is an affair of becoming. Not everybody becomes everybody [and everything: *tout le monde*—Trans.], makes a becoming of everybody/everything. This requires much asceti cism, much sobriety, much creative involution: an English elegance, an English fabric, blend in with the walls, eliminate the too-perceived, the too-much-to-be-perceived. "Eliminate all that is waste, death, and superfluity," complaint and grievance, unsatisfied desire, defense or pleading, everything that roots each of us (everybody) in ourselves, in our molarity.

Becoming everybody/everything *(tout le monde) *is to world *(faire monde), *to make a world *(faire un monde). *By process of elimination, one is no longer anything more than an abstract line, or a piece in a puzzle that is itself abstract. It is by conjugating, by continuing with other lines, other pieces, that one makes a world that can overlay the first one, like a transparency. Animal elegance, the camouflage fish, the clan destine: this fish is crisscrossed by abstract lines that resemble nothing, that do not even follow its organic divisions; but thus disorganized, disarticulated, it worlds with the lines of a rock, sand, and plants, becoming imperceptible. The fish is like the Chinese poet: not imitative or structural, but cosmic. Francois Cheng shows that poets do not pursue resemblance, any more than they calculate "geometric proportions." They retain, extract only the essential lines and movements of nature; they proceed only by continued or superposed "traits," or strokes. 63 It is in this sense that becoming-everybody/everything, making the world a becoming, is to world, to make a world or worlds, in other words, to find one's proximities and zones of indiscernibility. The Cosmos as an abstract machine, and each world as an assemblage effectuating it. If one reduces oneself to one or several abstract lines that will prolong itself in and conjugate with others, producing immediately, directly *a *world in which it is *the *world that becomes, then one becomes-everybody/everything. Kerouac's dream, and already Virginia Woolf s, was for the writing to be like the line of a Chinese poem-drawing. She says that it is necessary to "saturate every atom," and to do that it is necessary to eliminate, to eliminate all that is resemblance and analogy, but also "to put everything into it": eliminate everything that exceeds the moment, but put in everything that it includes—and the moment is not the instantaneous, it is the haecceity into which one slips and that slips into other haecceities by transparency. 64 To be present at the dawn of the world. Such is the link between imperceptibility, indis cernibility, and impersonality—the three virtues. To reduce oneself to an abstract line, a trait, in order to find one's zone of indiscernibility with other traits, and in this way enter the haecceity and impersonality of the creator. One is then like grass: one has made the world, everybody/ everything, into a becoming, because one has made a necessarily commu nicating world, because one has suppressed in oneself everything that prevents us from slipping between things and growing in the midst of things. One has combined "everything" *(le "tout"): *the indefinite article, the infinitive-becoming, and the proper name to which one is reduced. Sat urate, eliminate, put everything in.

Movements, becomings, in other words, pure relations of speed and slowness, pure affects, are below and above the threshold of perception. Doubtless, thresholds of perception are relative; there is always a threshold capable of grasping what eludes another: the eagle's eye... But the adequate threshold can in turn operate only as a function of a perceptible form and a perceived, discerned subject. So that movement in itself *continues *to occur elsewhere: if we serialize per ception, the movement always takes place above the maximum threshold and below the minimum threshold, in expanding or contracting intervals (microintervals). Like huge Japanese wrestlers whose advance is too slow and whose holds are too fast to see, so that what embraces are less the wrestlers than the infinite slowness of the wait (what is going to happen?) and the infinite speed of the result (what happened?). What we must do is reach the photographic or cinematic threshold; but in relation to the photograph, movement and affect once again took refuge above and below. When Kierkegaard adopts the marvelous motto, "I look only at the move ments," 65 he is acting astonishingly like a precursor of the cinema, multi plying versions of a love scenario (between Agnes and the merman) according to variable speeds and slownesses. He has all the more reason to say that there is no movement that is not infinite; that the movement of the infinite can occur only by means of affect, passion, love, in a becoming that is the girl, but without reference to any kind of "mediation"; and that this movement as such eludes any mediating perception because it is already effectuated at every moment, and the dancer or lover finds him- or herself already "awake and walking" the second he or she falls down, and even the instant he or she leaps. 66 Movement, like the girl as a fugitive being, cannot be perceived. However, we are obliged to make an immediate correction: movement also "must" be perceived, it cannot but be perceived, the imperceptible is also the *percipiendum. *There is no contradiction in this. If movement is imperceptible by nature, it is so always in relation to a given threshold of perception, which is by nature relative and thus plays the role of a media tion on the plane that effects the distribution of thresholds and percepts and makes forms perceivable to perceiving subjects. It is the plane of organization and development, the plane of transcendence, that renders perceptible without itself being perceived, without being capable of being perceived. But on the *other *plane, the plane of immanence or consistency, the principle of composition itself must be perceived, cannot but be per ceived at the same time as that which it composes or renders. In this case, movement is no longer tied to the mediation of a relative threshold that it eludes ad infinitum; it has reached, regardless of its speed or slowness, an absolute but differentiated threshold that is one with the construction of

It could also be said that move ment ceases to be the procedure of an always relative deterritorialization, becoming the process of absolute deterritorialization. The difference between the two planes accounts for the fact that what cannot be perceived on one cannot but be perceived on the other. It is in jumping from one plane to the other, or from the relative thresholds to the absolute threshold that coexists with them, that the imperceptible becomes necessarily perceived. Kierkegaard shows that the plane of the infinite, which he calls the plane of faith, must become a pure plane of immanence that continually and imme diately imparts, reimparts, and regathers the finite: unlike the man of infi nite resignation, the knight of the faith or man of becoming will get the girl, he will have all of the finite and perceive the imperceptible, as "heir appar ent to the finite." 67 Perception will no longer reside in the relation between a subject and an object, but rather in the movement serving as the limit of that relation, in the period associated with the subject and object. Percep tion will confront its own limit; it will be in the midst of things, throughout its own proximity, as the presence of one haecceity in another, the prehension of one by the other or the passage from one to the other: Look only at the movements. It is odd that the word "faith" should be used to designate a plane that works by immanence. But if the knight is the man of becoming, then there are all kinds of knights. Are there not even knights of narcotics, in the sense that faith is a drug (in a way very different from the sense in which religion is an opiate)? These knights claim that drugs, under necessary conditions of caution and experimentation, are inseparable from the deployment of a plane. And on this plane not only are becomings-woman, becomings-animal, becomings-molecular, becomings-imperceptible conjugated, but the imperceptible itself becomes necessarily perceived at the same time as perception becomes necessarily molecular: arrive at holes, microintervals between matters, colors and sounds engulfing lines of flight, world lines, lines of transparency and intersection. 68 *Change * *perception; *the problem has been formulated correctly because it presents "drugs" as a pregnant whole free of secondary distinctions (hallucinatory or nonhallucinatory, hard or soft, etc.). All drugs fundamentally concern speeds, and modifications of speed. What allows us to describe an overall Drug assemblage in spite of the differences between drugs is a line of perceptive causality that makes it so that (1) the imperceptible is perceived; (2) perception is molecular; (3) desire directly invests the perception and the perceived. The Americans of the beat generation had already embarked on this path, and spoke of a molecular revolution specific to drugs. Then came Castaneda's broad synthesis. Leslie Fiedler set forth the poles of the American Dream: cornered between two nightmares, the genocide of the Indians and the slav

D 283 ery of the blacks, Americans constructed a psychically repressed image of the black as the force of affect, of the multiplication of affects, but a socially repressed image of the Indian as subtlety of perception, perception made increasingly keen and more finely divided, infinitely slowed or acceler ated. 69 In Europe, Henri Michaux tended to be more willing to free himself of rites and civilizations, establishing admirable and minute protocols of experience, doing away with the question of causality with respect to drugs, delimiting drugs as well as possible, separating them from delirium and hallucination. But at this point everything reconnects: again, the problem is well formulated if we say that drugs eliminate forms and persons, if we bring into play the mad speeds of drugs and the extraordinary posthigh slownesses, if we clasp one to the other like wrestlers, if we confer upon per ception the molecular power to grasp microperceptions, microoperations, and upon the perceived the force to emit accelerated or decelerated parti cles in a floating time that is no longer our time, and to emit haecceities that are no longer of this world: deterritorialization, "I was disoriented . . ." (a perception of things, thoughts, desires in which desire, thought, and the thing have invaded all of perception: the imperceptible finally perceived). Nothing left but the world of speeds and slownesses without form, without subject, without a face. Nothing left but the zigzag of a line, like "the lash of the whip of an enraged cart driver" shredding faces and landscapes. 70 A whole rhizomatic labor of perception, the moment when desire and per ception meld. This problem of specific causality is an important one. Invoking causali ties that are too general or are extrinsic (psychological or sociological) is as good as saying nothing. There is a discourse on drugs current today that does no more than dredge up generalities on pleasure and misfortune, on difficulties in communication, on causes that always come from some where else. The more incapable people are of grasping a specific causality in extension, the more they pretend to understand the phenomenon in question. There is no doubt that an assemblage never contains a causal infrastructure. It does have, however, and to the highest degree, an abstract line of creative or specific causality, its *line of flight or of deterritorializa-  tion; *this line can be effectuated only in connection with general causalities of another nature, but is in no way explained by them. It is our belief that the issue of drugs can be understood only at the level where desire directly invests perception, and perception becomes molecular at the same time as the imperceptible is perceived. Drugs then appear as the agent of this becoming. This is where pharmacoanalysis would come in, which must be both compared and contrasted to psychoanalysis. For psychoanalysis must be taken simultaneously as a model, a contrasting approach, and a betrayal. Psychoanalysis can be taken as a model of reference because it was able,

But this schema still relies on a plane of organization that can never be apprehended in itself, that is always concluded from something else, that is always inferred, concealed from the system of perception: it is called the Unconscious. Thus the plane of the Unconscious remains a plane of tran scendence guaranteeing, justifying, the existence of psychoanalysis and the necessity of its interpretations. This plane of the Unconscious stands in molar opposition to the perception-consciousness system, and because desire must be *translated *onto this plane, it is itself linked to gross molarities, like the submerged part of an iceberg (the Oedipal structure, or the rock of castration). The imperceptible thus remains all the more imper ceptible because it is opposed to the perceived in a dualism machine. Everything is different on the plane of consistency or immanence, which is necessarily perceived in its own right in the course of its construction: experimentation replaces interpretation, now molecular, nonfigurative, and nonsymbolic, the unconscious as such is given in microperceptions; desire directly invests the field of perception, where the imperceptible appears as the perceived object of desire itself, "the nonfigurative of desire." The unconscious no longer designates the hidden principle of the transcendent plane of organization, but the process of the immanent plane of consistency as it appears on itself in the course of its construction. For the unconscious must be constructed, not rediscovered. There is no longer a conscious-unconscious dualism machine, because the unconscious is, or rather is produced, there where consciousness goes, carried by the plane. 71 Drugs give the unconscious the immanence and plane that psychoanalysis has consistently botched (perhaps the famous cocaine episode marked a turning point that forced Freud to renounce a direct approach to the unconscious). But if it is true that drugs are linked to this immanent, molecular percep tive causality, we are still faced with the question of whether they actually succeed in drawing the plane necessary for their action. The causal line, or the line of flight, of drugs is constantly being segmentarized under the most rigid of forms, that of dependency, the hit and the dose, the dealer. Even in its supple form, it can mobilize gradients and thresholds of perception toward becomings-animal, becomings-molecular, but even this is done in the context of a relativity of thresholds that restrict themselves to imitating a plane of consistency rather than drawing it on an absolute threshold. What good does it do to perceive as fast as a quick-flying bird if speed and movement continue to escape somewhere else? The deterritorializations remain relative, compensated for by the most abject reterritorializations, so that the imperceptible and perception continually pursue or run after

Instead of holes in the world allow ing the world lines themselves to run off, the lines of flight coil and start to swirl in black holes; to each addict a hole, group or individual, like a snail. Down, instead of high. The molecular microperceptions are overlaid in advance, depending on the drug, by hallucinations, delusions, false percep tions, phantasies, or paranoid outbursts; they restore forms and subjects every instant, like so many phantoms or doubles continually blocking con struction of the plane. Moreover, as we saw in our enumeration of the dan gers, not only is the plane of consistency in danger of being betrayed or thrown offtrack through the influence of other causalities that intervene in an assemblage of this kind, but the plane itself engenders dangers of its own, by which it is dismantled at the same time as it is constructed. We are no longer, it itself is no longer *master of speeds. *Instead of making a body without organs sufficiently rich or full for the passage of intensities, drug addicts erect a vitrified or emptied body, or a cancerous one: the causal line, creative line, or line of flight immediately turns into a line of death and abolition. The abominable vitrification of the veins, or the purulence of the nose—the glassy body of the addict. Black holes and lines of death, Artaud's and Michaux's warnings converge (they are more technical, more consistent than the informational, psychoanalytic, or sociopsychological discourse of treatment and assistance centers). Artaud: You will not avoid hallucinations, erroneous perceptions, shameless phantasies, or bad feel ings, like so many black holes on the plane of consistency, because your conscious will also go in that booby-trapped direction. 72 Michaux: You will no longer be master of your speeds, you will get stuck in a mad race between the imperceptible and perception, a race all the more circular now that everything is relative. 73 You will be full of yourself, you will lose control, you will be on a plane of consistency, in a body without organs, but at a place where you will always botch them, empty them, undo what you do, motionless rags. These words are so much simpler than "erroneous percep tions" (Artaud) or "bad feelings" (Michaux), but say the most technical of things: that the immanent molecular and perceptive causality of desire fails in the drug-assemblage. Drug addicts continually fall back into what they wanted to escape: a segmentarity all the more rigid for being marginal, a territorialization all the more artificial for being based on chemical sub stances, hallucinatory forms, and phantasy subjectifications. Drug addicts may be considered as precursors or experimenters who tirelessly blaze new paths of life, but their cautiousness lacks the foundation for caution. So they either join the legion of false heroes who follow the conformist path of a little death and a long fatigue. Or, what is worse, all they will have done is make an attempt only nonusers or former users can resume and benefit from, secondarily rectifying the always aborted plane of drugs, discovering

Is the mistake drug users make always to start over again from ground zero, either going on the drug again or quitting, when what they should do is make it a stopover, to start from the "middle," bifurcate from the middle? To succeed in getting drunk, but on pure water (Henry Miller). To succeed in getting high, but by abstention, "to take and abstain, espe cially abstain," I am a drinker of water (Michaux). To reach the point where "to get high or not to get high" is no longer the question, but rather whether drugs have sufficiently changed the general conditions of space and time perception so that nonusers can succeed in passing through the holes in the world and following the lines of flight at the very place where means other than drugs become necessary. Drugs do not guarantee immanence; rather, the immanence of drugs allows one to forgo them. Is it cowardice or exploi tation to wait until others have taken the risks? No, it is joining an under taking in the middle, while changing the means. It is necessary to choose the right molecule, the water, hydrogen, or helium molecule. This has noth ing to do with models, all models are molar: it is necessary to determine the molecules and particles in relation to which "proximities" (indiscern-ibilities, becomings) are engendered and defined. The vital assemblage, the life-assemblage, is *theoretically or logically *possible with all kinds of molecules, silicon, for example. But it so happens that this assemblage is not *machinically *possible with silicon: the abstract machine does not let it pass because it does not distribute zones of proximity that construct the plane of consistency. 74 We shall see that machinic reasons are entirely different from logical reasons or possibilities. One does not conform to a model, one straddles the right horse. Drug users have not chosen the right molecule or the right horse. Drugs are too unwieldy to grasp the imperceptible and becomings-imperceptible; drug users believed that drugs would grant them the plane, when in fact the plane must distill its own drugs, remaining master of speeds and proximities. ***Memories of the Secret. ***The secret has a privileged, but quite variable, relation to perception and the imperceptible. The secret relates first of all to certain contents. The content is *too big *for its form ... or else the con tents themselves have a form, but that form is covered, doubled, or replaced by a simple container, envelope, or box whose role it is to suppress formal relations. These are contents it has been judged fitting to isolate or disguise for various reasons. Drawing up a list of these reasons (shame, treasure, divinity, etc.) has limited value as long as the secret is opposed to its discovery as in a binary machine having only two terms, the secret and disclosure, the secret and desecration. For on the one hand, the secret as content is superseded by a perception of the secret, which is no less secret

From an anec dotal standpoint, the perception of the secret is the opposite of the secret, but from the standpoint of the concept, it is a part of it. What counts is that the perception of the secret must necessarily be secret itself: the spy, the voyeur, the blackmailer, the author of anonymous letters are no less secre tive than what they are in a position to disclose, regardless of their ulterior motives. There is always a woman, a child, a bird to secretly perceive the secret. There is always a perception finer than yours, a perception of your imperceptible, of what is in your box. We can even envision a profession of secrecy for those who are in a position to perceive the secret. The protector of the secret is not necessarily in on it, but is also tied to a perception, since he or she must perceive and detect those who wish to discover the secret (counterespionage). There is thus a first direction, in which the secret moves toward an equally secretive perception, a perception that seeks to be imperceptible itself. A wide variety of very different figures may revolve around this first point. And then there is a second point, just as inseparable from the secret as its content: the way in which it imposes itself and spreads. Once again, whatever the finalities or results, the secret has a way of spreading that is in turn shrouded in secrecy. The secret as secretion. The secret must sneak, insert, or introduce itself into the arena of public forms; it must pressure them and prod known subjects into action (we are refer ring to influence of the "lobby" type, even if the lobby is not in itself a secret society). In short, the secret, defined as a content that has hidden its form in favor of a simple container, is inseparable from two movements that can acci dentally interrupt its course or betray it, but are nonetheless an essential part of it: something must ooze from the box, something will be perceived through the box or in the half-opened box. The secret was invented by soci ety; it is a sociological or social notion. Every secret is a collective assem blage. The secret is not at all an immobilized or static notion. Only becomings are secrets; the secret has a becoming. The secret has its origin in the war machine; it is the war machine and its becomings-woman, becomings-child, becomings-animal that bring the secret. 75 A secret soci ety always acts in society as a war machine. Sociologists who have studied secret societies have determined many of their laws: protection, equalization and hierarchy, silence, ritual, deindividuation, centraliza tion, autonomy, compartmentalization, etc. 76 But perhaps they have not given enough weight to the principal laws governing the movement of con tent: (1) every secret society has a still more secret hindsociety, which either perceives the secret, protects it, or metes out the punishment for its disclo sure (it is not at all begging the question to define the secret society by the

This is evident in cases as diverse as the mob groups of the United States and the animal-men of Africa: on the one hand, there is the mode of influence of the secret society and its leaders on the political or public fig ures of its surroundings; and on the other hand, there is the secret society's mode of doubling itself with a hindsociety, which may constitute a special section of killers or guards. 77 Influence and doubling, secretion and concre tion, every secret operates between two "discreets" *[discrets: *also "discrete (terms)"—Trans.] that can, moreover, link or meld in certain cases. The child's secret combines these elements to marvelous effect: the secret as a content in a box, the secret influence and propagation of the secret, the secret perception of the secret (the child's secret is not composed of minia turized adult secrets but is necessarily accompanied by a secret perception of the adult secret). A child discovers a secret... But the becoming of the secret compels it not to content itself with con cealing its form in a simple container, or with swapping it for a container. The secret, as secret, must now acquire its own form. The secret is elevated from a finite content to the infinite form of secrecy. This is the point at which the secret attains absolute imperceptibility, instead of being linked to a whole interplay of relative perceptions and reactions. We go from a content that is well defined, localized, and belongs to the past, to the a pri ori general form of a nonlocalizable *something *that has happened. We go from the secret defined as a hysterical childhood content to secrecy defined as an eminently virile paranoid form. And this form displays the same two concomitants of the secret, the secret perception and the mode of action by secret influence; but these concomitants have become "traits" of a form they ceaselessly reconstitute, reform, recharge. On the one hand, paranoiacs denounce the international plot of those who steal their secrets, their most intimate thoughts; or they declare that they have the gift of per ceiving the secrets of others before they have formed (someone with para noid jealousy does not apprehend the other in the act of escaping; they divine or foresee the slightest intention of it). On the other hand, paranoi acs act by means of, or else suffer from, rays they emit or receive (Raymond

Influence by rays, and doubling by flight or echo, are what now give the secret its infinite form, in which perceptions as well as actions pass into imperceptibility. Paranoid judgment is like an antici pation of perception replacing empirical research into boxes and their con tents: *guilty *a priori, and in any event! (for example, the evolution of the narrator of the *Recherche *in relation to Albertine). We can say, in summary fashion, that psychoanalysis has gone from a hysterical to an increasingly paranoid conception of the secret. 78 Interminable analysis: the Uncon scious has been assigned the increasingly difficult task of itself being the infinite form of secrecy, instead of a simple box containing secrets. You will tell all, but in saying everything you will say nothing because all the "art" of psychoanalysis is required in order to measure your contents against the pure form. At this point, however, after the secret has been raised to the level of a form in this way, an inevitable adventure befalls it. When the question "What happened?" attains this infinite virile form, the answer is necessarily that nothing happened, and both form and content are destroyed. The news travels fast that the secret of men is nothing, in truth nothing at all. Oedipus, the phallus, castration, "the splinter in the flesh"— that was the secret? It is enough to make women, children, lunatics, and molecules laugh. The more the secret is made into a structuring, organizing form, the thinner and more ubiquitous it becomes, the more its content becomes molecular, at the same time as its form dissolves. It really wasn't much, as Jocasta says. The secret does not as a result disappear, but it does take on a more feminine status. What was behind President Schreber's paranoid secret all along, if not a becoming-feminine, a becoming-woman? For women do not handle the secret in at all the same way as men (except when they reconstitute an inverted image of virile secrecy, a kind of secrecy of the gyneceum). Men alternately fault them for their indiscretion, their gossip ing, and for their solidarity, their betrayal. Yet it is curious how a woman can be secretive while at the same time hiding nothing, by virtue of trans parency, innocence, and speed. The complex assemblage of secrecy in courtly love is properly feminine and operates in the most complete trans parency. Celerity against gravity. The celerity of a war machine against the gravity of a State apparatus. Men adopt a grave attitude, knights of the secret: "You see what burden I bear: my seriousness, my discretion." But they end up telling everything—and it turns out to be nothing. There are women, on the other hand, who tell everything, sometimes in appalling technical detail, but one knows no more at the end than at the beginning; they have hidden everything by celerity, by limpidity. They have no secret because they have become a secret themselves. Are they more politic than we? Iphigenia. *Innocent *a priori. That is the girl's defense against the

This is where the secret  reaches its ultimate state: its content is molecularized, it has become  molecular, at the same time as its form has been dismantled, becoming a  pure moving line—in the sense in which it can be said a given line is the  "secret" of a painter, or a given rhythmic cell, a given sound molecule  (which does not constitute a theme or form) the "secret" of a musician. If ever there was a writer who dealt with the secret, it was Henry James. In this respect, he went through an entire evolution, like a perfecting of his  art. For he began by looking for the secret in contents, even insignificant,  half-opened ones, contents briefly glimpsed. Then he raised the possibility  of there being an infinite form of secrecy that no longer even requires a con-  tent and that has conquered the imperceptible. But he raises this possi-  bility only in order to ask the question, Is the secret in the content or in the  form? And the answer is already apparent: *neither.* *19* * *James is one of those writers who is swept up in an irresistible becoming-woman. He never  stopped pursuing his goal, inventing the necessary technical means.  Mo-lecularize the content of the secret and linearize its form. James  explored it all, from the becoming-child of the secret (there is always a  child who discovers secrets: *What Maisie Knew) *to the becoming-woman  of the secret (secrecy by a transparency that is no longer anything more  than a pure line that scarcely leaves any traces of its own passage; the  admirable *Daisy Miller). *James is not as close to Proust as people say; it is  he who raises the cry, "Innocent a priori!" (all Daisy asked for was a little  respect, she would have given her love for that. . .) in opposition to the  "Guilty a priori" that condemns Albertine. What counts in the secret is  less its three states (child's content, virile infinite form, pure feminine  line) than the becomings attached to them, the becoming-child of the  secret, its becoming-feminine, its becoming-molecular—which occur  precisely at the point where the secret has lost both its content and its form,  where the imperceptible, the clandestine with nothing left to hide, has  finally been perceived. From the gray eminence to the gray immanence.  *Oedipus passes through all three secrets: *the secret of the sphinx whose  box he penetrates; the secret that weighs upon him as the infinite form of  his own guilt; and finally, the secret at Colonus that makes him inaccessible  and melds with the pure line of his flight and exile, he who has nothing  left to hide, or, like an old No actor, has only a girl's mask with which to  cover his lack of a face. Some people can talk, hide nothing, not lie: they  are secret by transparency, as impenetrable as water, in truth  incomprehensible. Whereas the others have a secret that is always  breached, even though they surround it with a thick wall or elevate it to an  infinite form.

0 1730: BECOMING-INTENSE, BECOMING-ANIMAL... D 291 ***Memories and Becomings, Points and Blocks. ***Why are there so many becomings of man, but no becoming-man? First because man is major-itarian par excellence, whereas becomings are minoritarian; all becoming is a becoming-minoritarian. When we say majority, we are referring not to a greater relative quantity but to the determination of a state or standard in relation to which larger quantities, as well as the smallest, can be said to be minoritarian: white-man, adult-male, etc. Majority implies a state of domination, not the reverse. It is not a question of knowing whether there are more mosquitoes or flies than men, but of knowing how "man" constituted a standard in the universe in relation to which men necessarily (analytically) form a majority. The majority in a government presupposes the right to vote, and not only is established among those who possess that right but is exercised over those who do not, however great their numbers; similarly, the majority in the universe assumes as pregiven the right and power of man. 80 In this sense women, children, but also animals, plants, and molecules, are minoritarian. It is perhaps the special situation of women in relation to the man-standard that accounts for the fact that becomings, being minoritarian, always pass through a becoming-woman. It is important not to confuse "minoritarian," as a becoming or process, with a "minority", as an aggregate or a state. Jews, Gypsies, etc., may constitute minorities under certain conditions, but that in itself does not make them becomings. One reterritorializes, or allows oneself to be reterritorialized, on a minority as a state; but in a becoming, one is deterritorialized. Even blacks, as the Black Panthers said, must become-black. Even women must become-woman. Even Jews must become-Jewish (it certainly takes more than a state). But if this is the case, then becoming-Jewish necessarily affects the non-Jew as much as the Jew. Becoming-woman necessary affects men as much as women. In a way, the subject in a becoming is always "man," but only when he enters a becoming-minoritarian that rends him from his major identity. As in Arthur Miller's novel, *Focus, *or Losey's film, *Mr. Klein: *it is the non-Jew who becomes Jewish, who is swept up in, carried off by, this becoming after being rent from his standard of measure. Conversely, if Jews themselves must become-Jewish, if women must become-woman, if children must become-child, if blacks must become-black, it is because only a minority is capable of serving as the active medium of becoming, but under such conditions that it ceases to be a definable aggregate in relation to the majority. Becoming-Jewish, becoming-woman, etc., therefore imply two simultaneous movements, one by which a term (the subject) is withdrawn from the majority, and another by which a term (the medium or agent) rises up from the minority. There is an asymmetrical and indissociable block of becoming, a block of alliance: the two "Mr. Kleins,"

A Jew becomes Jewish, but in a becoming-Jewish of the non-Jew. A becoming-minoritarian exists only by virtue of a deterritorialized medium and subject that are like its elements. There is no subject of the becoming except as a deterritorialized variable of the majority; there is no medium of becoming except as a deterritorialized variable of a minority. We can be thrown into a becoming by anything at all, by the most unexpected, most insignificant of things. You don't deviate from the majority unless there is a little detail that starts to swell and carries you off. It is because the hero of  *Focus, *the average American, needs glasses that give his nose a vaguely Semitic air, it is "because of the glasses" that he is thrown into this strange adventure of the becoming-Jewish of the non-Jew. Anything at all can do the job, but it always turns out to be a political affair. Becoming-minori tarian is a political affair and necessitates a labor of power *{puissance), *an active micropolitics. This is the opposite of macropolitics, and even of His tory, in which it is a question of knowing how to win or obtain a majority. As Faulkner said, to avoid ending up a fascist there was no other choice but to become-black. 81 Unlike history, becoming cannot be conceptualized in terms of past and future. Becoming-revolutionary remains indifferent to questions of a future and a past of the revolution; it passes between the two. Every becoming is a block of coexistence. The so-called ahistorical socie ties set themselves outside history, not because they are content to repro duce immutable models or are governed by a fixed structure, but because they are societies of becoming (war societies, secret societies, etc.). There is no history but of the majority, or of minorities as defined in relation to the majority. And yet "how to win the majority" is a totally secondary problem in relation to the advances of the imperceptible. Let us try to say it another way: There is no becoming-man because man is the molar entity par excellence, whereas becomings are molecular. The faciality function showed us the form under which man constitutes the majority, or rather the standard upon which the majority is based: white, male, adult, "rational," etc., in short, the average European, the subject of enunciation. Following the law of arborescence, it is this central Point that moves across all of space or the entire screen, and at every turn nourishes a certain distinctive opposition, depending on which faciality trait is retained: male-(female), adult-(child), white-(black, yellow, or red); rational-(animal). The central point, or third eye, thus has the property of organizing binary distributions within the dualism machines, and of reproducing itself in the principal term of the opposition; the entire oppo sition at the same time resonates in the central point.

1730: BECOMING-INTENSE, BECOMING-ANIMAL ... D 293 "majority" as redundancy. Man constitutes himself as a gigantic memory, through the position of the central point, its frequency (insofar as it is nec essarily reproduced by each dominant point), and its resonance (insofar as all of the points tie in with it). Any line that goes from one point to another in the aggregate of the molar system, and is thus defined by points answer ing to these mnemonic conditions of frequency and resonance, is a part of the arborescent system. 82 What constitutes arborescence is the submission of the line to the point. Of course, the child, the woman, the black have memories; but the Memory that collects those memories is still a virile majoritarian agency treating them as "childhood memories," as conjugal, or colonial memories. It is possible to operate by establishing a conjunction or collocation of contigu ous points rather than a relation between distant points: you would then have phantasies rather than memories. For example, a woman can have a female point alongside a male point, and a man a male point alongside a female one. The constitution of these hybrids, however, does not take us very far in the direction of a true becoming (for example, bisexuality, as the psychoanalysts note, in no way precludes the prevalence of the masculine or the majority of the "phallus"). One does not break with the arborescent schema, one does not reach becoming or the molecular, as long as a line is connected to two distant points, or is composed of two contiguous points. A line of becoming is not defined by points that it connects, or by points that compose it; on the contrary, it passes *between *points, it comes up through the middle, it runs perpendicular to the points first perceived, transversally to the localizable relation to distant or contiguous points. 83 A point is always a point of origin. But a line of becoming has neither begin ning nor end, departure nor arrival, origin nor destination; to speak of the absence of an origin, to make the absence of an origin the origin, is a bad play on words. A line of becoming has only a middle. The middle is not an average; it is fast motion, it is the absolute speed of movement. A becoming is always in the middle; one can only get it by the middle. A becoming is nei ther one nor two, nor the relation of the two; it is the in-between, the border or line of flight or descent running perpendicular to both. If becoming is a block (a line-block), it is because it constitutes a zone of proximity and indiscernibility, a no-man's-land, a nonlocalizable relation sweeping up the two distant or contiguous points, carrying one into the proximity of the other—and the border-proximity is indifferent to both contiguity and to distance. The line or block of becoming that unites the wasp and the orchid produces a shared deterritorialization: of the wasp, in that it becomes a lib erated piece of the orchid's reproductive system, but also of the orchid, in that it becomes the object of an orgasm in the wasp, also liberated from its own reproduction.

The line, or the block, does not link the wasp to the orchid, any more than it conjugates or mixes them: it passes between them, carrying them away in a shared proximity in which the discernibility of points dis appears. The line-system (or block-system) of becoming is opposed to the point-system of memory. Becoming is the movement by which the line frees itself from the point, and renders points indiscernible: the rhizome, the opposite of arborescence; break away from arborescence. *Becoming is  an antimemory. *Doubtless, there exists a molecular memory, but as a fac tor of integration into a majoritarian or molar system. Memories always have a reterritorialization function. On the other hand, a vector of deterritorialization is in no way indeterminate; it is directly plugged into the molecular levels, and the more deterritorialized it is, the stronger is the contact: it is deterritorialization that makes the aggregate of the molecular components "hold together." From this point of view, one may contrast a  *childhood block, *or a becoming-child, with the *childhood memory: *"a" molecular child is produced. . . "a" child coexists with us, in a zone of prox imity or a block of becoming, on a line of deterritorialization that carries us both off—as opposed to the child we once were, whom we remember or phantasize, the molar child whose future is the adult. "This will be child hood, but it must not be my childhood," writes Virginia Woolf. *{Orlando * already does not operate by memories, but by blocks, blocks of ages, block of epochs, blocks of the kingdoms of nature, blocks of sexes, forming so many becomings between things, or so many lines of deterritoriali zation.) 84 Wherever we used the word "memories" in the preceding pages, we were wrong to do so; we meant to say "becoming," we were saying becoming. If the line is opposed to the point (or blocks to memories, becoming to the faculty of memory), it is not in an absolute way: a punctual system includes a certain utilization of lines, and the block itself assigns the point new functions. In a punctual system, a point basically refers to linear coor dinates. Not only are a horizontal line and a vertical line represented, but the vertical moves parallel to itself, and the horizontal superposes other horizontals upon itself; every point is assigned in relation to the two base coordinates, but is also marked on a horizontal line of superposition and on a vertical line or plane of displacement. Finally, two points are con nected when any line is drawn from one to the other. *A system is termed  punctual*'when its lines are taken as coordinates in this way, or as localizable connections; for example, systems of arborescence, or molar and mne monic systems in general, are punctual. Memory has a punctual organiza tion because every present refers simultaneously to the horizontal line of  *the flow *of time (kinematics), which goes from an old present to the actual

D 295 present, and the vertical line of the *order *of time (stratigraphy), which goes from the present to the past, or to the representation of the old present. This is, of course, a basic schema that cannot be developed further without running into major complications, but it is the one found in representa tions of art forming a "didactic" system, in other words, a mnemotechnics. Musical representation, on the one hand, draws a horizontal, melodic line, the bass line, upon which other melodic lines are superposed; points are assigned that enter into relations of counterpoint between lines. On the other hand, it draws a vertical, harmonic line or plane, which moves along the horizontals but is no longer dependent upon them; it runs from high to low and defines a chord capable of linking up with the following chords. Pictorial representation has an analogous form, with means of its own: this is not only because the painting has a vertical and a horizontal, but because the traits and colors, each on its own account, relate to verticals of displace ment and horizontals of superposition (for example, the vertical cold form, or white, light and tonality; the horizontal warm form, or black, chromatics and modality, etc.). To cite only relatively recent examples, this is evident in the didactic systems of Kandinsky, Klee, and Mondrian, which neces sarily imply an encounter with music. Let us summarize the principal characteristics of a punctual system: (1) Systems of this kind comprise two base lines, horizontal and vertical; they serve as coordinates for assigning points. (2) The horizontal line can be superposed vertically and the vertical line can be moved horizontally, in such a way that new points are produced or reproduced, under conditions of horizontal frequency and vertical resonance. (3) From one point to another, a line can (or cannot) be drawn, but if it can it takes the form of a localizable connection; diagonals thus play the role of connectors between points of different levels or moments, instituting in their turn frequencies and resonances on the basis of these points of variable horizon or verticon, contiguous or distant. 85 These systems are arborescent, mnemonic, molar, structural; they are systems of territorialization or reterritorialization. The line and the diagonal remain totally subordinated to the point because they serve as coordinates for a point or as localizable connections for two points, running from one point to another. Opposed to the punctual system are linear, or rather multilinear, sys tems. Free the line, free the diagonal: every musician or painter has this intention. One elaborates a punctual system or a didactic representation, but with the aim of making it snap, of sending a tremor through it. A punc tual system is most interesting when there is a musician, painter, writer, philosopher to oppose it, who even fabricates it in order to oppose it, like a springboard to jump from. History is made only by those who oppose his tory (not by those who insert themselves into it, or even reshape it). This is

When this is done it always goes down in History but never comes from it. History may try to break its ties to memory; it may make the schemas of memory more elaborate, super pose and shift coordinates, emphasize connections, or deepen breaks. The dividing line, however, is not there. The dividing line passes not between history and memory but between punctual "history-memory" systems and diagonal or multilinear assemblages, which are in no way eternal: they have to do with becoming; they are a bit of becoming in the pure state; they are transhistorical. There is no act of creation that is not transhistorical and does not come up from behind or proceed by way of a liberated line. Nietzsche opposes history not to the eternal but to the subhistorical or superhistorical: the Untimely, which is another name for haecceity, becoming, the innocence of becoming (in other words, forgetting as opposed to memory, geography as opposed to history, the map as opposed to the tracing, the rhizome as opposed to arborescence). "The unhistorical is like an atmosphere within which alone life can germinate and with the destruction of which it must vanish. . . . What deed would man be capable of if he had not first entered into that vaporous region of the unhis torical?" 86 Creations are like mutant abstract lines that have detached themselves from the task of representing a world, precisely because they assemble a new type of reality that history can only recontain or relocate in punctual systems. When Boulez casts himself in the role of historian of music, he does so in order to show how a great musician, in a very different manner in each case, invents a kind of diagonal running between the harmonic vertical and the melodic horizon. And in each case it is a different diagonal, a different technique, a creation. Moving along this transversal line, which is really a line of deterritorialization, there is a *sound block *that no longer has a point of origin, since it is always and already in the middle of the line; and no longer has horizontal and vertical coordinates, since it creates its own coor dinates; and no longer forms a localizable connection from one point to another, since it is in "nonpulsed time": a deterritorialized rhythmic block that has abandoned points, coordinates, and measure, like a drunken boat that melds with the line or draws a plane of consistency. Speeds and slownesses inject themselves into musical form, sometimes impelling it to proliferation, linear microproliferations, and sometimes to extinction, sonorous abolition, involution, or both at once. The musician is in the best position to say: "I hate the faculty of memory, I hate memories." And that is

But it can equally be said that the Viennese school found a new system of territo-rialization, of points, verticals, and horizontals that position it in History. Another attempt, another creative act, came after it. The important thing is that all musicians have always proceeded in this way: drawing their own diagonal, however fragile, outside points, outside coordinates and localizable connections, in order to float a sound block down a created, liberated line, in order to unleash in space this mobile and mutant sound block, a haecceity (for example, chromaticism, aggregates, and complex notes, but already the resources and possibilities of polyphony, etc.). 87 Some have spoken of "oblique vectors" with respect to the organ. The diagonal is often composed of extremely complex lines and spaces of sound. Is that the secret of a little phrase or a rhythmic block? Undoubtedly, the point now assumes a new and essential creative function. It is no longer simply a question of an inevitable destiny reconstituting a punctual system; on the contrary, it is now the point that is subordinated to the line, the point now marks the proliferation of the line, or its sudden deviation, its acceleration, its slowdown, its furor or agony. Mozart's "microblocks." The block may even be reduced to a point, as though to a single note (point-block): Berg's B in *Wozzeck, *Schumann's A. Homage to Schumann, the madness of Schumann: the cello wanders across the grid of the orchestration, drawing its diagonal, along which the deterritorialized sound block moves; or an extremely sober kind of refrain is "treated" by a very elaborate melodic line and polyphonic architecture. In a multilinear system, everything happens at once: the line breaks free of the point as origin; the diagonal breaks free of the vertical and the hori zontal as coordinates; and the transversal breaks free of the diagonal as a localizable connection between two points. In short, a block-line passes amid *(au milieu des) *sounds and propels itself by its own nonlocalizable middle *(milieu). *The sound block is the *intermezzo. *It is a body without organs, an antimemory pervading musical organization, and is all the more sonorous: "The Schumannian body does not stay in place. ... The intermezzo [is] consubstantial with the entire Schumannian oeuvre.... At the limit, there are only intermezzi. ... The Schumannian body knows only bifurcations; it does not construct itself, it keeps diverging according to an accumulation of interludes.... Schumannian beating is panic, but it is also coded ... and it is because the panic of the blows apparently keeps within the limits of a docile language that it is ordinarily not perceived.. . .

In effect, the point does not make the line; the line sweeps away the deterritorialized  point, carries it off under its outside influence; the line does not go from  one point to another, but runs *between points *in a different direction that  renders them indiscernible. The line has become the diagonal, which has  broken free from the vertical and the horizontal. But the diagonal has  already become the transversal, the semidiagonal or free straight line, the  broken or angular line, or the curve—always in the midst of themselves.  Between the white vertical and the black horizontal lie Klee's gray,  Kandinsky's red, Monet's purple; each forms a block of color. This line is  without origin, since it always begins off the painting, which only holds it  by the middle; it is without coordinates, because it melds with a plane of  consistency upon which it floats and that it creates; it is without localizable  connection, because it has lost not only its representative function but any  function of outlining a form of any kind—by this token, the line has  become abstract, truly abstract and mutant, a visual block; and under these  conditions the point assumes creative functions again, as a color-point or  line-point. 89 The line is between points, in their midst, and no longer goes from one point to another. It does not outline a shape. "He did not paint  things, he painted between things." There is no falser problem in painting  than depth and, in particular, perspective. For perspective is only a histori-  cal manner *of occupying *diagonals or transversals, lines of flight *[lignes de  fuite: *here, the lines in a painting moving toward the vanishing point, or  *point de fuite*—Trans.], in other words, of reterritorializing the moving vis-  ual block. We use the word "occupy" in the sense of "giving an occupation  to," fixing a memory and a code, assigning a function. But the lines of  flight, the transversals, are suitable for many other functions besides this  molar function. Lines of flight as perspective lines, far from being made to  represent depth, themselves invent the possibility of such a representation,  which occupies them only for an instant, at a given moment. Perspective,  and even depth, are the reterritorialization of lines of flight, which alone  created painting by carrying it farther. What is called central perspective in  particular plunged the multiplicity of escapes and the dynamism of lines  into a punctual black hole. Conversely, it is true that problems of perspec-  tive triggered a whole profusion of creative lines, a mass release of visual  blocks, at the very moment they claimed to have gained mastery over them.  Is painting, in each of its acts of creation, engaged in a becoming as intense  as that of music?

0 1730: BECOMING-INTENSE, BECOMING-ANIMAL... D 299 *Becoming-Music. *We have tried to define in the case of Western music (although the other musical traditions confront an analogous problem, under different conditions, to which they find different solutions) a block of becoming at the level of expression, or a block of expression: this block of becoming rests on transversals that continually escape from the coordi nates or punctual systems functioning as musical codes at a given moment. It is obvious that there is a block of content corresponding to this block of expression. It is not really a correspondence; there would be no mobile "block" if a content, itself musical (and not a subject or a theme), were not always interfering with the expression. What does music deal with, what is the content indissociable from sound expression? It is hard to say, but it is something: *a *child dies, a child plays, a woman is born, a woman dies, a bird arrives, a bird flies off. We wish to say that these are not accidental themes in music (even if it is possible to multiply examples), much less imi tative exercises; they are something essential. Why a child, a woman, a bird? It is because musical expression is inseparable from a becoming-woman, a becoming-child, a becoming-animal that constitute its content. Why does the child die, or the bird fall as though pierced by an arrow? Because of the "danger" inherent in any line that escapes, in any line of flight or creative deterritorialization: the danger of veering toward destruction, toward abolition. Melisande [in Debussy's opera,  *Pelleas et Melisande*—Trans.], a child-woman, a secret, dies twice ("it's the poor little dear's turn now"). Music is never tragic, music is joy. But there are times it necessarily gives us a taste for death; not so much happiness as dying happily, being extinguished. Not as a function of a death instinct it allegedly awakens in us, but of a dimension proper to its sound assemblage, to its sound machine, the moment that must be confronted, the moment the transversal turns into a line of abolition. Peace  *and *exasperation. 90 Music has a thirst for destruction, every kind of destruction, extinction, breakage, dislocation. Is that not its potential "fascism"? Whenever a musician writes *In Memoriam, *it is not so much a question of an inspirational motif or a memory, but on the contrary of a becoming that is only confronting its own danger, even taking a fall in order to rise again: a becoming-child, a becoming-woman, a becoming-animal, insofar as they are the content of music itself and continue to the point of death. We would say that the *refrain *is properly musical content, the block of content proper to music. A child comforts itself in the dark or claps its hands or invents a way of walking, adapting it to the cracks in the sidewalk, or chants "Fort-Da" (psychoanalysts deal with the Fort-Da very poorly when they treat it as a phonological opposition or a symbolic component of the language-unconscious, when it is in fact a refrain).

Frr, Frr. Music is pervaded by childhood blocks, by blocks of femininity. Music is pervaded by every minority, and yet composes an immense power. Chil dren's, women's, ethnic, and territorial refrains, refrains of love and destruction: the birth of rhythm. Schumann's work is made of refrains, of childhood blocks, which he treats in a very special way: his own kind of becoming-child, his own kind of becoming-woman, Clara. It would be pos sible to catalogue the transversal or diagonal utilizations of the refrain in the history of music, all of the children's Games and *Kinderszenen, *all of the bird songs. But such a catalogue would be useless because it would seem like a multiplication of examples of themes, subjects, and motifs, when it is in fact a question of the most essential and necessary content of music. The motif of the refrain may be anxiety, fear, joy, love, work, walking, territory . . . but the refrain itself is the content of music. We are not at all saying that the refrain is the origin of music, or that music begins with it. It is not really known when music begins. The refrain is rather a means of preventing music, warding it off, or forgoing it. But music exists because the refrain exists also, because music takes up the refrain, lays hold of it as a content in a form of expression, because it forms a block with it in order to take it somewhere else. *The child's refrain, which  is not music, forms a block with the becoming-child of music: *once again, this asymmetrical composition is necessary. "Ah, vous dirai-je maman" ("Ah, mamma, now you shall know") in Mozart, Mozart's refrains. A theme in C, followed by twelve variations; not only is each note of the theme doubled, but the theme is doubled internally. Music submits the refrain to this very special treatment of the diagonal or transversal, it uproots the refrain from its territoriality. Music is a creative, active opera tion that consists in deterritorializing the refrain. Whereas the refrain is essentially territorial, territorializing, or reterritorializing, music makes it a deterritorialized content for a deterritorializing form of expression. Par don that sentence: what musicians do should be musical, it should be writ ten in music. Instead, we will give a figurative example: Mussorgsky's "Lullaby," in *Songs and Dances of Death, *presents an exhausted mother sit ting up with her sick child; she is relieved by a visitor, Death, who sings a lullaby in which each couplet ends with an obsessive, sober refrain, a repet itive rhythm with only one note, a point-block: "Shush, little child, sleep my little child" (not only does the child die, but the deterritorialization of the refrain is doubled by Death in person, who replaces the mother). Is the situation similar for painting, and if so, how? In no way do we believe in a fine-arts system; we believe in very diverse problems whose solutions are found in heterogeneous arts.

We have distinguished the following three states of the landscape problem: (1) semiotic systems of corporeality, silhouettes, postures, colors, and lines (these semiotic systems are already present in profusion among animals; the head is part of the body, and the body has the milieu, the biotope as its correlate; these systems already display very pure lines as, for example, in the "grass stem" behavior); (2) an organization of the face, white wall/black holes, face/eyes, or facial profile/sideview of the eyes (this semiotic system of faciality has the landscape as its correlate: facialization of the entire body and landscapification of all the milieus, Christ as the European central point); (3) a deterritorialization of faces and landscapes, in favor of probe-heads whose lines no longer outline a form or form a contour, and whose colors no longer lay out a landscape (this is the pictorial semiotic system: Put the face and the landscape to flight. For example, what Mondrian correctly calls a "landscape": a pure, absolutely deterrito-rialized landscape). For convenience, we presented three successive and distinct states, but only provisionally. We cannot decide whether animals have painting, even though they do not paint on canvas, and even when hormones induce their colors and lines; even here, there is little foundation for a clear-cut distinc tion between animals and human beings. Conversely, we must say that painting does not begin with so-called abstract art but recreates the silhou ettes and postures of corporeality, and is already fully in operation in the face-landscape organization (the way in which painters "work" the face of Christ, and make it leak from the religious code in all directions). The aim of painting has always been the deterritorialization of faces and land scapes, either by a reactivation of corporeality, or by a liberation of lines or colors, or both at the same time. There are many becomings-animal, becomings-woman, and becomings-child in painting. The problem of music is different, if it is true that its problem is the refrain. Deterritorializing the refrain, inventing lines of deterritorializa tion for the refrain, implies procedures and constructions that have noth ing to do with those of painting (outside of vague analogies of the sort painters have often tried to establish). Again, it is not certain whether we can draw a dividing line between animals and human beings: Are there not, as Messiaen believes, musician birds and nonmusician birds? Is the bird's

The difference between noise and sound is definitely not a basis for a definition of music, or even for the distinction between musician birds and nonmusician birds. Rather, it is the *labor of the refrain: *Does it remain territorial and territorializing, or is it carried away in a moving block that draws a transversal across all coordinates—and all of the intermediaries between the two? Music is pre cisely the adventure of the refrain: the way music lapses back into a refrain (in our head, in Swann's head, in the pseudo-probe-heads on TV and radio, the music of a great musician used as a signature tune, a ditty); the way it lays hold of the refrain, makes it more and more sober, reduced to a few notes, then takes it down a creative line that is so much richer, no origin or end of which is in sight. .. Leroi-Gourhan established a distinction and correlation between two poles, "hand-tool" and "face-language." But there it was a question of dis tinguishing a form of content and a form of expression. Here we are consid ering expressions that hold their content within themselves, so we must make a different distinction: the face with its visual correlates (eyes) con cerns painting; the voice with its auditory correlates (the ear is itself a refrain, it is shaped like one) concerns music. Music is a deterrito-rialization of the voice, which becomes less and less tied to language, just as painting is a deterritorialization of the face. Traits of vocability can indeed be indexed to traits of faciality, as in lipreading; they are not, however, in correspondence, especially when they are carried off by the respective movements of music and painting. The voice is far ahead of the face, very far ahead. Entitling a musical work *Visage *(Face) thus seems to be the greatest of sound paradoxes. 91 The only way to "line up" the two problems of painting and music is to take a criterion extrinsic to the fiction of the fine arts, to compare the forces of deterritorialization in each case. Music seems to have a much stronger deterritorializing force, at once more intense and much more collective, and the voice seems to have a much greater power of deterritorialization. Perhaps this trait explains the collective fascination exerted by music, and even the potentiality of the "fascist" danger we mentioned a little earlier: music (drums, trumpets) draws people and armies into a race that can go all the way to the abyss (much more so than banners and flags, which are paintings, means of classification and rallying). It may be that musicians are individually more reactionary than painters, more religious, less "social"; they nevertheless wield a collective force infinitely greater than that of painting: "The chorus formed by the assembly of the people is a very powerful bond..." It is always possible to explain this force by the material conditions of musical emission and reception, but it is preferable to take the reverse approach; these conditions are explained

It could be said that from the standpoint of the mutant abstract machine painting and music do not cor respond to the same thresholds, or that the pictorial machine and the musi cal machine do not have the same index. There is a "backwardness" of painting in relation to music, as Klee, the most musicianly of painters, observed. 92 Maybe that is why many people prefer painting, or why aes thetics took painting as its privileged model: there is no question that it "scares" people less. Even its relations to capitalism and social formations are not at all of the same type. Doubtless, in each case we must simultaneously consider factors of territoriality, deterritorialization, and reterritorialization. Animal and child refrains seem to be territorial: therefore they are not "music." But when music lays hold of the refrain and deterritorializes it, and deterrito-rializes the voice, when it lays hold of the refrain and sends it racing off in a rhythmic sound block, when the refrain "becomes" Schumann or Debussy, it is through a system of melodic and harmonic coordinates by means of which music reterritorializes upon itself, *qua * music. Conversely, we shall see that in certain cases even the animal refrain possesses forces of deterritorialization much more intense than animal silhouettes, postures, and colors. We must therefore take a number of factors into consideration: relative territorialities, their respective deterritorializations, and their correlative reterritorializations, several types of them (for example, intrinsic reterritorializations such as musical coordinates, and extrinsic ones such as the deterioration of the refrain into a hackneyed formula, or music into a ditty). The fact that there is no deterritorialization without a special reterritorialization should prompt us to rethink the abiding correlation between the molar and the molecular: no flow, no becoming-molecular escapes from a molar formation without molar components accompanying it, forming passages or perceptible landmarks for the imperceptible processes. The becoming-woman, the becoming-child of music are present in the problem of the machining of the voice. Machining the voice was the first musical operation. As we know, the problem was resolved in Western music in two different ways, in Italy and in England: the head voice of the countertenor, who sings "above his voice," or whose voice operates inside the sinuses and at the back of the throat and the palate without relying on the diaphragm or passing through the bronchial tubes; and the stomach voice of the castrati, "stronger, more voluminous, more languid," as if they gave carnal matter to the imperceptible, impalpable, and aerial. Dominique Fernandez wrote a fine book on this subject; he shows, fortu nately refraining from any psychoanalytic discussion of a link between music and castration, that the musical problem of the machinery of the

It is not cer tain, however, that the myth of the androgyne Fernandez invokes is ade quate. It is a question not of myth but of real becoming. The voice itself must attain a becoming-woman or a becoming-child. That is the prodi gious content of music. It is no longer a question, as Fernandez observes, of imitating a woman or a child, even if it is a child who is singing. The musi cal voice itself becomes-child at the same time as the child becomes-sonorous, purely sonorous. No child could ever have done that, or if one did, it would be by becoming in addition something other than a child, a child belonging to a different, strangely sensual and celestial, world. In short, the deterritorialization is double: the voice is deterritorialized in a becoming-child, but the child it becomes is itself deterritorialized, unen-gendered, becoming. "The child grew wings," said Schumann. We find the same zigzag movement in the becomings-animal of music: Marcel More shows that the music of Mozart is permeated by a becoming-horse, or becomings-bird. But no musician amuses himself by "playing" horse or bird. If the sound block has a becoming-animal as its content, then the animal simultaneously becomes, in sonority, something else, something absolute, night, death, joy—certainly not a generality or a simplification, but a haecceity, this death, that night. Music takes as its content a becoming-animal; but in that becoming-animal the horse, for example, takes as its expression soft kettledrum beats, winged like hooves from heaven or hell; and the birds find expression in *gruppeti, * appoggiaturas, staccato notes that transform them into so many souls. 94 It is the accents that form the diagonal in Mozart, the accents above all. If one does not follow the accents, if one does not observe them, one falls back into a relatively impoverished punctual system. The human musician is deterritorialized in the bird, but it is a bird that is itself deterritorialized, "transfigured," a celestial bird that has just as much of a becoming as that which becomes with it. Captain Ahab is engaged in an irresistible becoming-whale with Moby-Dick; but the animal, Moby-Dick, must simultaneously become an unbearable pure whiteness, a shimmering pure white wall, a silver thread that stretches out and supples up "like" a girl, or twists like a whip, or stands like a rampart. Can it be that literature sometimes catches up with painting, and even music? And that painting catches up with music? (More cites Klee's birds but on the other hand fails to understand what Messiaen says about bird song.) No art is imitative, no art can be imitative or figurative. Suppose a painter "represents" a bird; this is in fact a becoming-bird that can occur only to the extent that the bird itself is in the process of becoming something else, a pure line and pure color. Thus imitation self-destructs,

One imi tates only if one fails, when one fails. The painter and musician do not imi tate the animal, they become-animal at the same time as the animal becomes what they willed, at the deepest level of their concord with Nature. 95 Becoming is always double, that which one becomes becomes no less than the one that becomes—block is formed, essentially mobile, never in equilibrium. Mondrian's is the perfect square. It balances on one corner and produces a diagonal that half-opens its closure, carrying away both sides. Becoming is never imitating. When Hitchcock does birds, he does not reproduce bird calls, he produces an electronic sound like a field of intensi ties or a wave of vibrations, a continuous variation, like a terrible threat welling up inside us. 96 And this applies not only to the "arts": *Moby-Dick^ * effect also hinges the pure lived experience of double becoming, and the book would not have the same beauty otherwise. The tarantella is a strange dance that magically cures or exorcises the supposed victims of a tarantula bite. But when the victim does this dance, can he or she be said to be imitat ing the spider, to be identifying with it, even in an identification through an "archetypal" or "agonistic" struggle? No, because the victim, the patient, the person who is sick, becomes a dancing spider only to the extent that the spider itself is supposed to become a pure silhouette, pure color and pure sound to which the person dances. 97 One does not imitate; one constitutes a block of becoming. Imitation enters in only as an adjustment of the block, like a finishing touch, a wink, a signature. But everything of importance happens elsewhere: in the becoming-spider of the dance, which occurs on the condition that the spider itself becomes sound and color, orchestra and painting. Take the case of the local folk hero, Alexis the Trotter, who ran "like" a horse at extraordinary speed, whipped himself with a short switch, whinnied, reared, kicked, knelt, lay down on the ground in the manner of a horse, competed against them in races, and against bicycles and trains. He imitated a horse to make people laugh. But he had a deeper zone of proxim ity or indiscernibility. Sources tell us that he was never as much of a horse as when he played the harmonica: precisely because he no longer needed a regulating or secondary imitation. It is said that he called his harmonica his "chops-destroyer" and played the instrument twice as fast as anyone else, doubled the beat, imposed a nonhuman tempo. 98 Alexis became all the more horse when the horse's bit became a harmonica, and the horse's trot went into double time. As always, the same must be said of the animals themselves. For not only do animals have colors and sounds, but they do not wait for the painter or musician to use those colors and sounds in a painting or music, in other words, to enter into determinate becomings

Ethology is advanced enough to have entered this realm. We are not at all arguing for an aesthetics of qualities, as if the pure quality (color, sound, etc.) held the secret of a becoming without measure, as in *Philebus. *Pure qualities still seem to us to be punctual systems: They are reminiscences, they are either transcendent or floating memories or seeds of phantasy. A functionalist conception, on the other hand, only considers the function a quality fulfills in a specific assemblage, or in passing from one assemblage to another. The quality must be considered from the standpoint of the becoming that grasps it, instead of becoming being considered from the standpoint of intrinsic qualities having the value of archetypes or phylogenetic memories. For example, whiteness, color, is gripped in a becoming-animal that can be that of the painter or of Captain Ahab, and at the same time in a becoming-color, a becoming-whiteness, that can be that of the animal itself. Moby-Dick's whiteness is the special index of his becoming-solitary. Colors, silhouettes, and animal refrains are indexes of becoming-conjugal or becoming-social that also imply components of deterritorialization. A quality functions only as a line of deterritorialization of an assemblage, or in going from one assemblage to another. This is why an animal-block is something other than a phylogenetic memory, and a childhood block something other than a childhood memory. In Kafka, a quality never functions for itself or as a memory, but rather rectifies an assemblage in which it is deterritori-alized, and, conversely, for which it provides a line of deterritorialization; for example, the childhood steeple passes into the castle tower, takes it at the level of its zone of indiscernibility ("battlements that were irregular, broken, fumbling"), and launches down a line of flight (as if one of the tenants "had burst through the roof'). 99 If things are more complicated and less sober for Proust, it is because for him qualities retain an air of reminiscence *or *phantasy, and yet with Proust as well these are functional blocks acting not as memories or phantasies but as a becoming-child, a becoming-woman, as components of deterritorialization passing from one assemblage to another. To the theorems of simple deterritorialization we encountered earlier (in our discussion of the face), 100 we can now add others on generalized double deterritorialization. *Theorem Five: *deterritorialization is always double, because it implies the coexistence of a major variable and a minor variable in simultaneous becoming (the two terms of a becoming do not exchange places, there is no identification between them, they are instead drawn into an asymmetrical block in which both change to the same extent, and which constitutes their zone of proximity). *Theorem Six: *in non

D 307 symmetrical double deterritorialization it is possible to assign a deter-ritorializing force and a deterritorialized force, even if the same force switches from one value to the other depending on the "moment" or aspect considered; furthermore, it is the least deterritorialized element that always triggers the deterritorialization of the most deterritorializing element, which then reacts back upon it in full force. *Theorem Seven: *the deterritorializing element has the relative role of expression, and the deterritorialized element the relative role of content (as evident in the arts); but not only does the content have nothing to do with an external sub ject or object, since it forms an asymmetrical block with the expression, but the deterritorialization carries the expression and the content to a proxim ity where the distinction between them ceases to be relevant, or where the deterritorialization creates their indiscernibility (example: the sound diag onal as the musical form of expression, and becomings-woman, -child, -animal as the contents proper to music, as refrains). *Theorem Eight: *one assemblage does not have the same forces or even speeds of deterrito rialization as another; in each instance, the indices and coefficients must be calculated according to the block of becoming under consideration, and in relation to the mutations of an abstract machine (for example, there is a certain slowness, a certain viscosity, of painting in relation to music; but one cannot draw a symbolic boundary between the human being and ani mal. One can only calculate and compare powers of deterritorialization). Fernandez demonstrates the presence of becomings-woman, becom ings-child in vocal music. Then he decries the rise of instrumental and orchestral music; he is particularly critical of Verdi and Wagner for having resexualized the voice, for having restored the binary machine in response to the requirements of capitalism, which wants a man to be a man and a woman a woman, each with his or her own voice: Verdi-voices, Wagner-voices, are reterritorialized upon man *and *woman. He explains the premature disappearance of Rossini and Bellini (the retirement of the first and death of the second) by their hopeless feeling that the vocal becomings of the opera were no longer possible. However, Fernandez does not ask under what auspices, and with what new types of diagonals, this occurs. To begin with, it is true that the voice ceases to be machined for itself, with simple instrumental accompaniment; it ceases to be a stratum or a line of expression that stands on its own. But why? Music crossed a new threshold of deterritorialization, beyond which it is the instrument that machines the voice, and the voice and instrument are carried *on the  same plane *in a relation that is sometimes one of confrontation, sometimes one of compensation, sometimes one of exchange and complementarity. The lied, in particular Schumann's lieder, perhaps marks the first appearance of this pure movement that places the voice and the piano on the same plane of

Even a case like Verdi's: it has often been said that his opera remains lyrical and vocal in spite of its destruction of the bel canto, and in spite of the importance of orchestration in the final works; still, voices are instrumentalized and make extraordinary gains in tessitura or extension (the production of the Verdi-baritone, of the Verdi-soprano). At any rate, the issue is not a given composer, especially not Verdi, or a given genre, but the more general movement affecting music, the slow mutation of the musical machine. If the voice returns to a binary distribu tion of the sexes, this occurs in relation to binary groupings of instruments in orchestration. There are always molar systems in music that serve as coordinates; this dualist system of the sexes that reappears on the level of the voice, this molar and punctual distribution, serves as a foundation for new molecular flows that then intersect, conjugate, are swept up in a kind of instrumentation and orchestration that tend to be part of the creation itself. Voices may be reterritorialized on the distribution of the two sexes, but the continuous sound flow still passes between them as in a difference of potential. This brings us to the second point: the principal problem concerning this new threshold of deterritorialization of the voice is no longer that of a properly vocal becoming-woman or becoming-child, but that of a becoming-molecular in which the voice itself is instrumentalized. Of course, becomings-woman and -child remain just as important, even take on new importance, but only to the extent that they convey another truth: what was produced was already a molecular child, a molecular woman .. . We need only think of Debussy: the becoming-child and the becoming-woman in his works are intense but are now inseparable from a molecu-larization of the motif, a veritable "chemistry" achieved through orchestration. The child and the woman are now inseparable from the sea and the water molecule *(Sirens, *precisely, represents one of the first complete attempts to integrate the voice with the orchestra). Already Wagner was reproached for the "elementary" character of his music, for its aquaticism, or its "atomization" of the motif, "a subdivision into infinitely small units." This becomes even clearer if we think of becoming-animal: birds are still just as important, yet the reign of birds seems to have been replaced by the age of insects, with its much more molecular vibrations, chirring, rustling, buzzing, clicking, scratching, and scraping. Birds are vocal, but insects are instrumental: drums and violins, guitars and cymbals. 101 A becoming-insect has replaced becoming-bird, or forms a block with it. The insect is closer, better able to make audible the truth that all becomings are molecular (cf. Martenot's waves, electronic music). The molecular has the capacity to make the *elementary *communicate with the  *cosmic: *precisely

D 309 because it effects a dissolution of form that connects the most diverse lon gitudes and latitudes, the most varied speeds and slownesses, which guar antees a continuum by stretching variation far beyond its formal limits. Rediscover Mozart, and that the "theme" was a variation from the start. Varese explains that the sound molecule (the block) separates into ele ments arranged in different ways according to variable relations of speed, but also into so many waves or flows of a sonic energy irradiating the entire universe, a headlong line of flight. That is how he populated the Gobi desert with insects and stars constituting a becoming-music of the world, or a diagonal for a cosmos. Messiaen presents multiple chromatic durations in coalescence, "alternating between the longest and the shortest, in order to suggest the idea of the relations between the infinitely long durations of the stars and mountains and the infinitely short ones of the insects and atoms: a cosmic, elementary power that... derives above all from the labor of rhythm." 102 The same thing that leads a musician to discover the birds also leads him to discover the elementary and the cosmic. Both combine to form a block, a universe fiber, a diagonal or complex space. Music dis patches molecular flows. Of course, as Messiaen says, music is not the priv ilege of human beings: the universe, the cosmos, is made of refrains; the question in music is that of a power of deterritorialization permeating nature, animals, the elements, and deserts as much as human beings. The question is more what is not musical in human beings, and what already is musical in nature. Moreover, what Messiaen discovered in music is the same thing the ethologists discovered in animals: human beings are hardly at an advantage, except in the means of overcoding, of making punctual systems. That is even the opposite of having an advantage; through becomings-woman, -child, -animal, or -molecular, nature opposes its power, and the power of music, to the machines of human beings, the roar of factories and bombers. And it is necessary to reach that point, it is neces sary for the nonmusical sound of the human being to form a block with the becoming-music of sound, for them to confront and embrace each other like two wrestlers who can no longer break free from each other's grasp, and slide down a sloping line: "Let the choirs represent the survivors. . . Faintly one hears the sound of cicadas. Then the notes of a lark, followed by the mockingbird. Someone laughs ... A woman sobs . . . From a male a great shout: WE ARE LOST ! A woman's voice: WE ARE SAVED ! Staccato cries: Lost! Saved! Lost! Saved!" 103

0 1837: OF THE REFRAIN □ 311 I. A child in the dark, gripped with fear, comforts himself by singing under  his breath. He walks and halts to his song. Lost, he takes shelter, or orients  himself with his little song as best he can. The song is like a rough sketch of a  calming and stabilizing, calm and stable, center in the heart of chaos. Per-  haps the child skips as he sings, hastens or slows his pace. But the song itself  is already a skip: it jumps from chaos to the beginnings of order in chaos  and is in danger of breaking apart at any moment. There is always sonority  in Ariadne's thread. Or the song of Orpheus. II. Now we are at home. But home does not preexist: it was necessary to draw a circle around that uncertain and fragile center, to organize a limited  space. Many, very diverse, components have a part in this, landmarks and  marks of all kinds. This was already true of the previous case. But now the  components are used for organizing a space, not for the momentary deter  mination of a center. The forces of chaos are kept outside as much as possi  ble, and the interior space protects the germinal forces of a task to fulfill or  a deed to do. This involves an activity of selection, elimination and extrac  tion, in order to prevent the interior forces of the earth from being sub  merged, to enable them to resist, or even to take something from chaos  across the filter or sieve of the space that has been drawn. Sonorous or vocal  components are very important: a wall of sound, or at least a wall with  some sonic bricks in it. A child hums to summon the strength for the  schoolwork she has to hand in. A housewife sings to herself, or listens to the  radio, as she marshals the antichaos forces of her work. Radios and televi  sion sets are like sound walls around every household and mark territories  (the neighbor complains when it gets too loud). For sublime deeds like the  foundation of a city or the fabrication of a golem, one draws a circle, or bet  ter yet walks in a circle as in a children's dance, combining rhythmic vowels  and consonants that correspond to the interior forces of creation as to the  differentiated parts of an organism.

Finally, one opens the circle a crack, opens it all the way, lets some one in, calls someone, or else goes out oneself, launches forth.

As though the circle tended  on its own to open onto a future, as a function of the working forces it shel  ters. This time, it is in order to join with the forces of the future, cosmic  forces.

0 312 □ 1837: OF THE REFRAIN of drift" with different loops, knots, speeds, movements, gestures, and sonorities. 1 These are not three successive moments in an evolution. They are three aspects of a single thing, the Refrain *{ritournelle). *They are found in tales (both horror stories and fairy tales), and in lieder as well. The refrain has all three aspects, it makes them simultaneous or mixes them: sometimes, sometimes, sometimes. Sometimes chaos is an immense black hole in which one endeavors to fix a fragile point as a center. Sometimes one organizes around that point a calm and stable "pace" (rather than a form): the black hole has become a home. Sometimes one grafts onto that pace a breakaway from the black hole. Paul Klee presented these three aspects, and their interlinkage, in a most profound way. He calls the black hole a "gray point" for pictorial reasons. The gray point starts out as nonlocal-izable, nondimensional chaos, the force of chaos, a tangled bundle of aberrant lines. Then the point "jumps over itself and radiates a dimensional space with horizontal layers, vertical cross sections, unwritten customary lines, a whole terrestrial interior force (this force also appears, at a more relaxed pace, in the atmosphere and in water). The gray point (black hole) has thus jumped from one state to another, and no longer represents chaos but the abode or home. Finally, the point launches out of itself, impelled by wandering centrifugal forces that fan out to the sphere of the cosmos: one "tries convulsively to fly from the earth, but at the following level one actually rises above it... powered by centrifugal forces that triumph over gravity." 2 The role of the refrain has often been emphasized: it is territorial, a terri torial assemblage. Bird songs: the bird sings to mark its territory. The Greek modes and Hindu rhythms are themselves territorial, provincial, regional. The refrain may assume other functions, amorous, professional or social, liturgical or cosmic: it always carries earth with it; it has a land (sometimes a spiritual land) as its concomitant; it has an essential relation to a Natal, a Native. A musical "nome" is a little tune, a melodic formula that seeks recognition and remains the bedrock or ground of polyphony  *{cantus firmus). *The *nomos *as customary, unwritten law is inseparable from a distribution of space, a distribution in space. By that token, it is  *ethos, *but the ethos is also the Abode. 3 Sometimes one goes from chaos to the threshold of a territorial assemblage: directional components, infra-assemblage. Sometimes one organizes the assemblage: dimensional components, intra-assemblage. Sometimes one leaves the territorial assemblage for other assemblages, or for somewhere else entirely: interassem-blage, components of passage or even escape. And all three at once. Forces of chaos, terrestrial forces, cosmic forces: all of these confront each other and converge in the territorial refrain.

0 1837: OF THE REFRAIN D 313 From chaos, *Milieus *and *Rhythms *are born. This is the concern of very ancient cosmogonies. Chaos is not without its own directional compo nents, which are its own ecstasies. We have seen elsewhere how all kinds of milieus, each defined by a component, slide in relation to one another, over one another. Every milieu is vibratory, in other words, a block of space-time constituted by the periodic repetition of the component. Thus the living thing has an exterior milieu of materials, an interior milieu of composing elements and composed substances, an intermediary milieu of membranes and limits, and an annexed milieu of energy sources and actions-perceptions. Every milieu is coded, a code being defined by peri odic repetition; but each code is in a perpetual state of transcoding or transduction. Transcoding or transduction is the manner in which one milieu serves as the basis for another, or conversely is established atop another milieu, dissipates in it or is constituted in it. The notion of the milieu is not unitary: not only does the living thing continually pass from one milieu to another, but the milieus pass into one another, they are essen tially communicating. The milieus are open to chaos, which threatens them with exhaustion or intrusion. Rhythm is the milieus' answer to chaos. What chaos and rhythm have in common is the in-between—between two milieus, rhythm-chaos or the chaosmos: *"Between *night and day, between that which is constructed and that which grows naturally, between muta tions from the inorganic to the organic, from plant to animal, from animal to humankind, yet without this series constituting a progression ..." In this in-between, chaos becomes rhythm, not inexorably, but it has a chance to. Chaos is not the opposite of rhythm, but the milieu of all milieus. There is rhythm whenever there is a transcoded passage from one milieu to another, a communication of milieus, coordination between heterogene ous space-times. Drying up, death, intrusion have rhythm. It is well known that rhythm is not meter or cadence, even irregular meter or cadence: there is nothing less rhythmic than a military march. The tom-tom is not 1 -2, the waltz is not 1, 2, 3, music is not binary or ternary, but rather forty-seven basic meters, as in Turkish music. Meter, whether regular or not, assumes a coded form whose unit of measure may vary, but in a noncommunicating milieu, whereas rhythm is the Unequal or the Incommensurable that is always undergoing transcoding. Meter is dogmatic, but rhythm is critical; it ties together critical moments, or ties itself together in passing from one milieu to another. It does not operate in a homogeneous space-time, but by heterogeneous blocks. It changes direction. Bachelard is right to say that  *"the link between truly active moments (rhythm) is always effected on a dif-  ferent plane from the one upon which the action is carried out."* *4* * *Rhythm is never on the same plane as that which has rhythm. Action occurs in a milieu, whereas rhythm is located between two milieus, or between two

Landing, splashdown, takeoff.. . This easily avoids an aporia that threatened to introduce meter into rhythm, despite all the dec larations of intent to the contrary: How can one proclaim the constituent inequality of rhythm while at the same time admitting implied vibrations, periodic repetitions of components? A milieu does in fact exist by virtue of a periodic repetition, but one whose only effect is to produce a difference by which the milieu passes into another milieu. It is the difference that is rhythmic, not the repetition, which nevertheless produces it: productive repetition has nothing to do with reproductive meter. This is the "critical solution of the antinomy." One case of transcoding is particularly important: when a code is not content to take or receive components that are coded differently, and instead takes or receives fragments of a different code as such. The first case pertains to the leaf-water relation, the second to the spider-fly rela tion. It has often been noted that the spider web implies that there are sequences of the fly's own code in the spider's code; it is as though the spi der had a fly in its head, a fly "motif," a fly "refrain." The implication may be reciprocal, as with the wasp and the orchid, or the snapdragon and the bumblebee. Jakob von Uexkiill has elaborated an admirable theory of transcodings. He sees the components as melodies in counterpoint, each of which serves as a motif for another: Nature as music. 5 Whenever there is transcoding, we can be sure that there is not a simple addition, but the con stitution of a new plane, as of a surplus value. A melodic or rhythmic plane, surplus value of passage or bridging. The two cases, however, are never pure; they are in reality mixed (for example, the relation of the leaf, this time not to water in general but to rain). Still, we do not yet have a *Territory, *which is not a milieu, not even an additional milieu, nor a rhythm or passage between milieus. The territory is in fact an act that affects milieus and rhythms, that "territorializes" them. The territory is the product of a territorialization of milieus and rhythms. It amounts to the same thing to ask when milieus and rhythms become territorialized, and what the difference is between a nonterritorial animal and a territorial animal. A territory borrows from all the milieus; it bites into them, seizes them bodily (although it remains vulnerable to intrusions). It is built from aspects or portions of milieus. It itself has an exterior milieu, an interior milieu, an intermediary milieu, and an annexed milieu. It has the interior zone of a residence or shelter, the exte rior zone of its domain, more or less retractable limits or membranes, intermediary or even neutralized zones, and energy reserves or annexes. It is by essence marked by "indexes," which may be components taken from

0 1837: OF THE REFRAIN D 315 any of the milieus: materials, organic products, skin or membrane states, energy sources, action-perception condensates. There is a territory pre cisely when milieu components cease to be directional, becoming dimen sional instead, when they cease to be functional to become expressive. There is a territory when the rhythm has expressiveness. What defines the territory is the emergence of matters of expression (qualities). Take the example of color in birds or fish: color is a membrane state associated with interior hormonal states, but it remains functional and transitory as long as it is tied to a type of action (sexuality, aggressiveness, flight). It becomes expressive, on the other hand, when it acquires a temporal constancy and a spatial range that make it a territorial, or rather territorializing, mark: a sig nature. 6 The question is not whether color resumes its functions or fulfills new ones in the territory. It is clear that it does, but this reorganization of functions implies first of all that the component under consideration has become expressive and that its meaning, from this standpoint, is to mark a territory. The same species of birds may have colored and uncolored repre sentatives; the colored birds have a territory, whereas the all-white ones are gregarious. We know what role urine and excrement play in marking, but territorial excrement, for example, in the rabbit, has a particular odor owing to specialized anal glands. Many monkeys, when serving as guards, expose their brightly colored sexual organs: the penis becomes a rhythmic and expressive color-carrier that marks the limits of the territory. 7 A milieu component becomes both a quality and a property, *quale *and *proprium. *It has been remarked how quick this becoming is in many cases, the rapidity with which a territory is constituted at the same time as expressive quali ties are selected or produced. The brown stagemaker *{Scenopoeetes  dentirostris) *lays down landmarks each morning by dropping leaves it picks from its tree, and then turning them upside down so the paler underside stands out against the dirt: inversion produces a matter of expression. 8 The territory is not primary in relation to the qualitative mark; it is the mark that makes the territory. Functions in a territory are not primary; they presuppose a territory-producing expressiveness. In this sense, the territory, and the functions performed within it, are products of territorialization. Territorialization is an act of rhythm that has become expressive, or of milieu components that have become qualitative. The marking of a territory is dimensional, but it is not a meter, it is a rhythm. It retains the most general characteristic of rhythm, which is to be inscribed on a different plane than that of its actions. But now the distinction between the two planes is between territorializing expressions and territorialized functions. That is why we cannot accept a thesis like Lorenz's, *which tends to make aggressiveness the basis of the territory: *the territory would then be the product of the phylogenetic evolution of an

0 316 D 1837: OF THE REFRAIN instinct of aggression, starting at the point where that instinct became intraspecific, was turned against the animal's own kind. A territorial ani mal would direct its aggressiveness against members of its own species; the species would gain the selective advantage of distributing its members throughout a space where each would have its own place. 9 This ambiguous thesis, which has dangerous political overtones, seems to us to have little foundation. It is obvious that the function of aggression changes pace when it becomes intraspecific. but this reorganization of the function, rather than explaining the territory, presupposes it. there are numerous reorgani zations within the territory, which also affect sexuality, hunting, etc.; there are even new functions, such as building a place to live. These functions are organized or created only because they are *territorialized, *and not the other way around. The T factor, the territorializing factor, must be sought elsewhere: precisely in the becoming-expressive of rhythm or melody, in other words, in the emergence or proper qualities (color, odor, sound, silhouette...). Can this becoming, this emergence, be called Art? That would make the territory a result of art. The artist: the first person to set out a boundary stone, or to make a mark. Property, collective or individual, is derived from that even when it is in the service of war and oppression. Property is funda mentally artistic because art is fundamentally *poster, placard. *As Lorenz says, coral fish are posters. The expressive is primary in relation to the pos sessive; expressive qualities, or matters of expression, are necessarily appropriative and constitute a having more profound than being. 10 Not in the sense that these qualities belong to a subject, but in the sense that they delineate a territory that will belong to the subject that carries or produces them. These qualities are signatures, but the signature, the proper name, is not the constituted mark of a subject, but the constituting mark of a domain, an abode. The signature is not the indication of a person; it is the chancy formation of a domain. Abodes have proper names, and are inspired. "The inspired and their abodes . . ."; it is with the abode that inspiration arises. No sooner do I like a color that I make it my standard or placard. One puts one's signature on something just as one plants one's flag on a piece of land. A high school supervisor stamped all the leaves strewn about the school yard and then put them back in their places. He had signed. Territorial marks are readymades. And what is called *art brut *in not at all pathological or primitive; it is merely this constitution, this freeing, of matters of expression in the movement of territoriality: the base or ground of art. Take anything and make it a matter of expression. The stagemaker practices *art brut. *Artists are stagemakers, even when they tear up their own posters. Of course, from this standpoint art is not the privilege of human beings. Messiaen is right in saying that many birds are not only vir

0 1837: OF THE REFRAIN □ 317 tuosos but artists, above all in their territorial songs (if a robber "improp erly wishes to occupy a spot which doesn't belong to it, the true owner sings and sings so well that the predator goes away.... If the robber sings better than the true proprietor, the proprietor yields his place"). 11 The refrain is rhythm and melody that have been territorialized because they have become expressive—and have become expressive because they are territorializing. We are not going in circles. What we wish to say is that there is a self-movement of expressive qualities. Expressiveness is not reducible to the immediate effects of an impulse triggering an action in a milieu: effects of that kind are subjective impressions or emotions rather than expressions (as, for example, the temporary color a freshwater fish takes on under a given impulse). On the other hand, expressive qualities, the colors of the coral fish, for example, are auto-objective, in other words, find an objectivity in the territory they draw. What is this objective movement? What does a matter *do *as a matter of expression? It is first of all a poster or placard, but that is not all it is. It merely takes that route. The signature becomes style. In effect, *expressive  qualities or matters of expression enter shifting relations with one another  that "express" the relation of the territory they draw to the interior milieu of  impulses and exterior milieu of circumstances. *To express is not to depend upon; there is an autonomy of expression. On the one hand, expressive qualities entertain internal relations with one another that constitute *terri-  torial motifs; *sometimes these motifs loom above the internal impulses, sometimes they are superposed upon them, sometimes they ground one impulse in another, sometimes they pass and cause a passage from one impulse to another, sometimes they insert themselves between them—but they are not themselves "pulsed." Sometimes these nonpulsed motifs arise in a fixed form, or seem to arise that way, but at other times the same ones, or others, take on variable speed and articulation; it is as much their varia bility as their fixity that makes them independent of the drives they com bine or neutralize. "We know that our dogs go through motions of smelling, seeking, chasing, biting, and shaking to death with equal enthusiasm whether they are hungry or not." 12 Another example is the dance of the stickleback. Its zigzag is a motif in which the zig is tied to an aggressive drive toward the partner, and the zag to a sexual drive toward the nest; yet the zig and the zag are accented, or even oriented, differently. On the other hand, expressive qualities also entertain other internal relations that pro duce *territorial counterpoints: *this refers to the manner in which they con stitute points in the territory that place the circumstances of the external milieu in counterpoint. For example, an enemy approaches or suddenly appears, or rain starts to fall, the sun rises, the sun sets... Here again, the points or counterpoints are autonomous in their fixity or variability in

0 318 □ 1837: OF THE REFRAIN relation to the circumstances of the exterior milieu whose relation to the territory they express. For this relation can be given without the circum stances being given, just as the relation to the impulses can be given with out the impulse being given. And even when the impulses and circum stances are given, the relation is prior to what it places in relation. Relations between matters of expression express relations of the territory to internal impulses and external circumstances: they have an autonomy within this very expression. In truth, territorial motifs and counterpoints explore potentialities of the interior or exterior milieu. Ethologists have grouped these phenomena under the concept of "ritualization" and have demonstrated the link between animal rituals and territory. But this word is not necessarily appropriate for these nonpulsed motifs and nonlocalized counterpoints, since it accounts for neither their variability nor their fixity. It is not one *or *the other, fixity or variability; certain motifs or points are fixed only if others are variable, or else they are fixed on one occasion and variable on another. We should say, rather, that territorial motifs form *rhythmic faces or char-* *acters, *and that territorial counterpoints form *melodic landscapes. *There is a rhythmic character when we find that we no longer have the simple situa tion of a rhythm associated with a character, subject, or impulse. The rhythm itself is now the character in its entirety; as such, it may remain con stant, or it may be augmented or diminished by the addition or subtraction of sounds or always increasing or decreasing durations, and by an amplifi cation or elimination bringing death or resuscitation, appearance or disap pearance. Similarly, the melodic landscape is no longer a melody associ ated with a landscape; the melody itself is a sonorous landscape in counterpoint to a virtual landscape. That is how we get beyond the placard stage: although each expressive quality, each matter of expression consid ered in itself, is a placard or poster, the analysis of them is nevertheless abstract. Expressive qualities entertain variable or constant relations with one another (that is what matters of expression *do); *they no longer consti tute placards that mark a territory, but motifs and counterpoints that express the relation of the territory to interior impulses or exterior circum stances, whether or not they are given. No longer signatures, but a style. What objectively distinguishes a musician bird from a nonmusician bird is precisely this aptitude for motifs and counterpoints that, if they are varia ble, or even when they are constant, make matters of expression something other than a poster—a style—since they articulate rhythm and harmonize melody. We can then say that the musician bird goes from sadness to joy or that it greets the rising sun or endangers itself in order to sing or sings better than another, etc. None of these formulations carries the slightest risk of anthropomorphism, or implies the slightest interpretation. It is instead a

0 1837: OF THE REFRAIN D 319 kind of geomorphism. The relation to joy and sadness, the sun, danger, per fection, is given in the motif and counterpoint, even if the term of each of these relations is not given. In the motif and the counterpoint, the sun, joy or sadness, danger, become sonorous, rhythmic, or melodic. 13 Human music also goes this route. For Swann, the art lover, Vinteuil's little phrase often acts as a placard associated with the Bois de Boulogne and the face and character of Odette: as if it reassured Swann that the Bois de Boulogne was indeed his territory, and Odette his possession. There is already something quite artistic in this way of hearing music. Debussy crit icized Wagner, comparing his leitmotifs to signposts signaling the hidden circumstances of a situation, the secret impulses of a character. The criti cism is accurate, on one level or at certain moments. But as the work devel ops, the motifs increasingly enter into conjunction, conquer *their own  plane, *become autonomous from the dramatic action, impulses, and situa tions, and independent of characters and landscapes; they themselves become melodic landscapes and rhythmic characters continually enrich ing their internal relations. They may then remain relatively constant, or on the contrary grow or diminish, expand or contract, vary in the speed at which they unfold: in both cases, they are no longer pulsed and localized, and even the constants are in the service of variation; the more provisory they are, the more they display the continuous variation they resist, the more rigid they become. 14 Proust was among the first to underscore this life of the Wagnerian motif. Instead of the motif being tied to a character who appears, the appearance of the motif itself constitutes a rhythmic character in "the plenitude of a music that is indeed filled with so many strains, each of which is a being." 15 It is not by chance that the apprenticeship of the *Recherche *pursues an analogous discovery in relation to Vinteuil's little phrases: they do not refer to a landscape; they carry and develop within themselves landscapes that do not exist on the outside (the white sonata and red septet. ..). The discovery of the properly melodic landscape and the properly rhythmic character marks the moment of art when it ceases to be a silent painting on a signboard. This may not be art's last word, but art went that route, as did the bird: motifs and counterpoints that form an autodevelopment, in other words, a style. The interiorization of the melodic or sonorous landscape finds its exemplary form in Liszt and that of the rhythmic character in Wagner. More generally, the lied is the musical art of the landscape, the most pictorial, impressionist form of music. But the two poles are so closely bound that in the lied as well Nature appears as a rhythmic character with infinite transformations. The territory is first of all the critical distance between two beings of the same species: Mark your distance. What is mine is first of all my distance; I possess only distances.

0 320 D 1837: OF THE REFRAIN my territory, I put up placards. Critical distance is a relation based on mat ters of expression. It is a question of keeping at a distance the forces of chaos knocking at the door. *Mannerism: *the ethos is both abode and man ner, homeland and style. This is evident in territorial dances termed baroque or mannerist, in which each pose, each movement, establishes a distance of this kind (sarabands, allemandes, bourrees, gavottes.. .). 16 There is a whole art of poses, postures, silhouettes, steps, and voices. Two schizophrenics converse or stroll according to laws of boundary and terri tory that may escape us. How very important it is, when chaos threatens, to draw an inflatable, portable territory. If need be, I'll put my territory on my own body, I'll territorialize my body: the house of the tortoise, the hermit age of the crab, but also tattoos that make the body a territory. Critical dis tance is not a meter, it is a rhythm. But the rhythm, precisely, is caught up in a becoming that sweeps up the distances between characters, making them rhythmic characters that are themselves more or less distant, more or less combinable (intervals). Two animals of the same sex and species confront each other: the rhythm of the first one "expands" when it approaches its territory or the center of its territory; the rhythm of the second contracts when it moves away from its territory. Between the two, at the boundaries, an oscillational constant is established: an active rhythm, a passively endured rhythm, and a witness rhythm? 17 Or else the animal opens its terri tory a crack for a partner of the opposite sex: a complex rhythmic character forms through duets, antiphonal or alternating singing, as in the case of African shrikes. Furthermore, we must simultaneously take into account two aspects of the territory: it not only ensures and regulates the coexis tence of members of the same species by keeping them apart, but makes possible the coexistence of a maximum number of different species in the same milieu by specializing them. Members of the same species enter into rhythmic characters at the same time as different species enter into melodic landscapes; for the landscapes are peopled by characters and the characters belong to landscapes. An example is Messiaen's  *Chrono-chromie, *with its eighteen bird songs forming autonomous rhythmic characters and simultaneously realizing an extraordinary landscape in complex counterpoint, with invented or implicit chords. Not only does art not wait for human beings to begin, but we may ask if art ever appears among human beings, except under artificial and belated conditions. It has often been noted that human art was for a long time bound up with work and rites of a different nature. Saying this, however, perhaps has no more weight than saying that art begins with human beings. For it is true that a territory has two notable effects: *a reorganization of  functions and a regrouping of forces. *On the one hand, when functional activities are territorialized they necessarily change pace (the creation of

0 1837: OF THE REFRAIN □ 321 new functions such as building a dwelling, or the transformation of old functions, as when aggressiveness changes nature and becomes intra-specific). This is like a nascent theme of specialization or professionalism: if the territorial refrain so often passes into professional refrains, it is because professions assume that various activities are performed in the same milieu, and that the same activity has no other agents in the same territory. Professional refrains intersect in the milieu, like merchants' cries, but each marks a territory within which the same activity cannot be performed, nor the same cry ring out. In animals as in human beings, there are rules of critical distance for competition: my stretch of sidewalk. In short, a territorialization of functions is the condition for their emergence as "occupations" or "trades." Thus intraspecific or specialized aggressiveness is necessarily a territorialized aggressiveness; it does not explain the territory since it itself derives from it. It is immediately apparent that all activities within the territory adopt a new practical pace. But that is no reason to conclude that art in itself does not exist here, for it is present in the territorializing factor that is the necessary condition for the emergence of the work-function. The situation is the same if we consider the other effect of territori alization. That other effect, which relates not to occupations but to rites and religions, consists in this: the territory groups all the forces of the dif ferent milieus together in a single sheaf constituted by the forces of the earth. The attribution of all the diffuse forces to the earth as receptacle or base takes place only at the deepest level of each territory. "The surround ing milieu was experienced as a unity; it is very hard to distinguish in these primal intuitions what belongs properly to the earth from what is merely manifested through the earth: mountains, forests, water, vegetation." 18 The forces of air and water, bird and fish, thus become forces of the earth. Moreover, although in extension the territory separates the interior forces of the earth from the exterior forces of chaos, the same does not occur in "intension," in the dimension of depth, where the two types of force clasp and are wed in a battle whose only criterion and stakes is the earth. There is always a place, a tree or grove, in the territory where all the forces come together in a hand-to-hand combat of energies. The earth is this close embrace. 19 This intense center is simultaneously inside the territory, and outside several territories that converge on it at the end of an immense pil grimage (hence the ambiguities of the "natal"). Inside or out, the territory is linked to this intense center, which is like the unknown homeland, terres trial source of all forces friendly and hostile, where everything is decided. 20 So we must once again acknowledge that religion, which is common to human beings and animals, occupies territory only because it depends on the raw aesthetic and territorializing factor as its necessary condition. It is

We always come back to this "moment": the becoming-expressive of rhythm, the emergence of expressive proper qualities, the formation of matters of expression that develop into motifs and counterpoints. We therefore need a notion, even an apparently negative one, that can grasp this fictional or raw moment. The essential thing is the disjunction notice able between the code and the territory. The territory arises in a free margin of the code, one that is not indeterminate but rather is determined differ ently. Each milieu has its own code, and there is perpetual transcoding between milieus; the territory, on the other hand, seems to form at the level of a certain *decoding. *Biologists have stressed the importance of these determined margins, which are not to be confused with mutations, in other words, changes internal to the code: here, it is a question of duplicated genes or extra chromosomes that are not inside the genetic code, are free of function, and offer a free matter for variation. 21 But it is very unlikely that this kind of matter could create new species independently of mutations, unless it were accompanied by events of another order capable of multiply ing the interactions of the organism with its milieus. Territorialization is precisely such a factor that lodges on the margins of the code of a single spe cies and gives the separate representatives of that species the possibility of differentiating. It is because there is a disjunction between the territory and the code that the territory can indirectly induce new species. Wherever territoriality appears, it establishes an intraspecific *critical distance * between members of the same species; it is by virtue of its own disjunction in relation to *specific differences *that it becomes an oblique, indirect means of differentiation. From all of these standpoints, decoding appears as the "negative" of the territory, and the most obvious distinction between terri torial animals and nonterritorial animals is that the former are much less coded than the latter. We have said enough bad things about the territory that we can now evaluate all the creations that tend toward it, occur within it, and result or will result from it. We have gone from forces of chaos to forces of the earth. From milieus to territory. From functional rhythms to the becoming-expressive of rhythm. From phenomena of transcoding to phenomena of decoding. From milieu functions to territorialized functions. It is less a question of evolution than of passage, bridges and tunnels. We saw that milieus continually pass into one another. Now we see that the milieus pass into the territory. The

0 1837: OF THE REFRAIN D 323 expressive qualities we term aesthetic are certainly not "pure" or symbolic qualities but proper qualities, in other words, appropriative qualities, pas sages from milieu components to territory components. The territory itself is a place of passage. The territory is the first assemblage, the first thing to constitute an assemblage; the assemblage is fundamentally territorial. But how could it not already be in the process of passing into something else, into other assemblages? That is why we could not talk about the constitu tion of the territory without also talking about its internal organization. We could not describe the infra-assemblage (posters or placards) without also discussing the intra-assemblage (motifs and counterpoints). Nor can we say anything about the intra-assemblage without already being on the path to other assemblages, or elsewhere. The passage of the Refrain. The refrain moves in the direction of the territorial assemblage and lodges itself there or leaves. In a general sense, *we call a refrain any aggregate of matters  of expression that draws a territory and develops into territorial motifs and  landscapes *(there are optical, gestural, motor, etc., refrains). In the narrow sense, we speak of a refrain when an assemblage is sonorous or "domi nated" by sound—but why do we assign this apparent privilege to sound? We are now in the intra-assemblage. Its organization is very rich and complex. It includes not only the territorial assemblage but also assem bled, territorialized functions. Take the Troglodytidae, the wren family: the male takes possession of his territory and produces a "music box refrain" as a warning to possible intruders; he builds his own nests in his territory, sometimes as many as a dozen; when a female arrives, he sits in front of a nest, invites her to visit, hangs his wings, and lowers the inten sity of his song, reduced to a mere trill. 22 It seems that the nesting function is highly territorialized, since the nests are prepared by the male alone before the arrival of the female, who only visits and completes them; the "courtship" function is also territorialized, but to a lesser degree, since the territorial refrain becomes seductive by changing in intensity. All kinds of heterogeneous elements show up in the intra-assemblage: not only the assemblage marks that group materials, colors, odors, sounds, postures, etc., but also the various elements of given assembled behaviors that enter into a motif. For example, a display behavior is composed of a dance, clicking of the beak, an exhibition of colors, a posture with neck outstretched, cries, smoothing of the feathers, bows, a refrain. .. The first question to be asked is what holds these territorializing marks, territorial motifs, and territorialized functions together in the same intra-assem blage. This is a question *of consistency: *the "holding together" of hetero geneous elements. At first, they constitute no more than a fuzzy set, a discrete set that later takes on consistency.

324 □ 1837: OF THE REFRAIN But another question seems to interrupt or cut across the first one. For in many cases, a territorialized, assembled function acquires enough independence to constitute a new assemblage, one that is more or less deterritorialized, en route to deterritorialization. There is no need to effectively leave the territory to go this route; but what just a minute ago was a constituted function in the territorial assemblage has become the constituting element of another assemblage, the element of passage to another assemblage. As in courtly love, a color ceases to be territorial and enters a "courtship" assemblage. The territorial assemblage opens onto the courtship assemblage, which is a social assemblage that has gained autonomy. That is what happens when it is specifically the sexual partner or the members of a group that are recognized, rather than the territory: The partner is then said to be a *Tier mit der Heimvalenz, *"an animal with home value." There is therefore a distinction to be made between milieu groups and couples (without individual recognition), territorial groups and couples (in which there is only recognition inside the territory), and finally social groups and love couples (when there is recognition indepen dent of place). 23 Courtship, or the group, is no longer a part of the territorial assemblage; a courtship or group assemblage takes on autonomy— even though it may stay inside the territory. Conversely, in the new assemblage there is a reterritorialization on the member of the couple or members of the group that have-the-value-of (valence). This opening of the assemblage onto other assemblages can be analyzed in detail, and varies widely. For example, when the male does not make the nest and confines himself to transporting materials or mimicking the construction of a nest (as in Australian grass finches), he either courts the female holding a piece of stubble in his beak (genus *Bathilda), *uses the grass stem only in the initial stages of courtship or even beforehand (genera *Aidemosyne *and  *Lonchura), *or pecks at the grass without offering it (genus *Emblema).* *24 * It could always be said that these "grass stem" behaviors are merely archa isms, or vestiges of nesting behavior. But the notion of behavior itself proves inadequate to this assemblage. For when the nest is no longer made by the male, nesting ceases to be a component of the territorial assemblage—it takes wing, so to speak, from the territory; furthermore, courtship, which now precedes nesting, itself becomes a relatively autono mous assemblage. In addition, the matter of expression, "grass stem," acts as a component of passage between the territorial assemblage and the courtship assemblage. The fact that the grass stem has an increasingly rudimentary function in certain species, the fact that it tends to cancel out in the series under consideration, is not enough to make it a vestige, much less a symbol. A matter of expression is never a vestige or a symbol. The grass stem is a deterritorialized component, or one en route to

It is an *assemblage converter. *The stem cancels out precisely because it is a component of passage from one assemblage to another. This viewpoint is confirmed by the fact that if the stem cancels out, another relay component replaces it or assumes greater importance, namely, the refrain, which is not only territorial but becomes amorous and social, and changes accordingly. 25 The question of why, in the constitution of new assemblages, the sound component "refrain" has a stronger valence than the gestural component "grass stem" can be consid ered only later on. The important thing for now is to note this formation of new assemblages within the territorial assemblage, and this movement from the intra-assemblage to interassemblages by means of components of passage and relay: An innovative opening of the territory onto the female, or the group. Selective pressure proceeds by way of interassemblages. It is as though forces of deterritorialization affected the territory itself, causing us to pass from the territorial assemblage to other types of assemblages (courtship or sexuality assemblages, group or social assemblages). The grass stem and the refrain are two agents of these forces, two agents of deterritorialization. The territorial assemblage continually passes into other assemblages. Likewise, the infra-assemblage is inseparable from the intra-assemblage, as is the intra-assemblage from interassemblages; yet these passages are not necessary but rather take place "on a case-by-case basis." The reason is simple: the intra-assemblage, the territorial assemblage, territorializes func tions and forces (sexuality, aggressiveness, gregariousness, etc.), and in the process of territorializing them, transforms them. But these territorialized functions and forces can suddenly take on an autonomy that makes them swing over into other assemblages, compose other deterritorialized assemblages. In the intra-assemblage, sexuality may appear as a territorialized function, but it can just as easily draw a line of deterritorialization that describes another assemblage; there are therefore quite variable relations between sexuality and the territory, as if sexuality were keeping "its distance." Profession, trade, and specialty imply territorialized activities, but they can also take wing from the territory, building a new assemblage around themselves, and between professions. A territorial or territorialized component may set about budding, pro ducing: this is the case for the refrain, so much so that we should perhaps call all cases of this kind refrains. This ambiguity between the territory and deterritorialization is the ambiguity of the Natal. It is understood much more clearly if it is borne in mind that the territory has an intense center at its profoundest depths; but as we have seen, this intense center can be located outside the territory, at the point of convergence of very

0 326 D 1837: OF THE REFRAIN different and very distant territories. The Natal is outside. We may cite a certain number of troubling and well-known, more or less mysterious, cases illustrating prodigious takeoffs from the territory, displaying a vast movement of deterritorialization directly plugged into the territories and permeating them through and through: (1) pilgrimages to the source, as among salmon; (2) supernumerary assemblies, such as those of locusts or chaffinches, etc. (tens of millions of chaffinches near Thoune in 1950-1951); (3) magnetic or solar-guided migrations; (4) long marches, such as those of the lobsters. 26 Whatever the causes of each of these movements, it is clear that the nature of the movement is different. It is no longer adequate to say that there is interassemblage, passage from a territorial assemblage to another type of assemblage; rather, we should say that one leaves all assemblages behind, that one exceeds the capacities of any possible assemblage, enter ing another plane. In effect, there is no longer a milieu movement or rhythm, nor a territorialized or territorializing movement or rhythm; there is something of the Cosmos in these more ample movements. The localiza tion mechanisms are still extremely precise, but the localization has become cosmic. These are no longer territorialized forces bundled together as forces of the earth; they are the liberated or regained forces of a deterritorialized Cosmos. In migration, the sun is no longer the terrestrial sun reigning over a territory, even an aerial one; it is the celestial sun of the Cosmos, as in the two Jerusalems, the Apocalypse. Leaving aside these two grandiose cases where deterritorialization becomes absolute while losing nothing of its precision (because it weds cosmic variables), we must remark that the territory is constantly traversed by movements of deterrito rialization that are relative and may even occur in place, by which one passes from the intra-assemblage to interassemblages, without, however, leaving the territory or issuing from the assemblages in order to wed the Cosmos. A territory is always en route to an at least potential deterrito rialization, even though the new assemblage may operate a reterritoriali-zation (something that "has-the-value-of' home). We saw that the territory constituted itself on a margin of decoding affecting the milieu; we now see that there is a margin of deterritorialization affecting the territory itself. There is a series of unclaspings. The territory is inseparable from certain coefficients of deterritorialization (which can be evaluated in each case) that place the relations of each territorialized function to the territory in variation, as well as the relations of the territory to each deterritorialized assemblage. It is the same "thing" that appears first as a territorialized function taken up in the intra-assemblage, and again as a deterritorialized or autonomous assemblage, as an interassemblage. Refrains could accordingly be classified as follows: (1) territorial

At infinity, these refrains must rejoin the songs of the Molecules, the newborn wailing of the funda mental Elements, as Millikan put it. They cease to be terrestrial, becoming cosmic: when the religious Nome blooms and dissolves in a molecular pan theist Cosmos, when the singing of the birds is replaced by combinations of water, wind, clouds, and fog. "Outside, the wind and the rain ..." The Cos mos as an immense deterritorialized refrain). The problem of *consistency *concerns the manner in which the compo nents of a territorial assemblage hold together. But it also concerns the manner in which different assemblages hold together, with components of passage and relay. It may even be the case that consistency finds the totality of its conditions only on a properly cosmic plane, where all the disparate and heterogeneous elements are convoked. However, from the moment heterogeneities hold together in an assemblage or interassemblages a prob lem of consistency is posed, in terms of coexistence or succession, and both simultaneously. Even in a territorial assemblage, it may be the most deter ritorialized component, the deterritorializing vector, in other words, the refrain, that assures the consistency of the territory. If we ask the general question, "What holds things together?", the clearest, easiest answer seems to be provided by a formalizing, linear, hierarchized, centralized  *arborescent *model. Take Tinbergen's schema, which presents a coded link age of spatiotemporal forms in the central nervous system: a higher func tional center goes automatically into operation and releases an appetitive behavior in search of specific stimuli (the migrational center); through the intermediary of the stimulus, a second center that had been inhibited up to this point is freed and releases a new appetitive behavior (the territorial center); then other subordinate centers are activated, centers of fighting,

But by orienting it along the axes of inhibition-release, innate-acquired, they risk reintroducing souls and centers at each locus and stage of linkage. That is why even the authors who stress the role of the peripheral and the acquired at the level of releasing stimuli do not truly overturn the linear aborescent schema, even if they reverse the direction of the arrows. It seems more important to us to underline a certain number of factors liable to suggest an entirely different schema, one favoring rhizomatic, rather than arborified, functioning, and no longer operating by these dual isms. First of all, what is called a functional center brings into play not only a localization but also a distribution of an entire population of neurons selected from throughout the central nervous system, as in a "cable net work." This being the case, in considering the system as a whole we should speak less of automatism of a higher center than of coordination between centers, and of the cellular groupings or molecular populations that per form these couplings: there is no form or correct structure imposed from without or above but rather an articulation from within, as if oscillating molecules, oscillators, passed from one heterogeneous center to another, if only for the purpose of assuring the dominance of one among them. 29 This obviously excludes any linear relation from one center to another, in favor of packets of relations steered by molecules: the interaction or coordina tion may be positive *or *negative (release or inhibition), but it is never direct, as in a linear relation or chemical reaction; it always occurs between molecules with at least two heads, and each center taken separately. 30 This represents a whole behavioral-biological "machinics," a whole molecular engineering that should help increase our understanding of the nature of problems of consistency. The philosopher Eugene Dupreel pro posed a theory of *consolidation; *he demonstrated that life went not from a center to an exteriority but from an exterior to an interior, or rather from a discrete or fuzzy aggregate to its consolidation. This implies three things. First, that there is no beginning from which a linear sequence would derive, but rather densifications, intensifications, reinforcements, injections, showerings, like so many intercalary events ("there is growth only by inter calation"). Second, and this is not a contradiction, there must be an arrangement of intervals, a distribution of inequalities, such that it is sometimes necessary to make a hole in order to consolidate. Third, there is

1837: OF THE REFRAIN D 329 a superposition of disparate rhythms, an articulation from within of an interrhythmicity, with no imposition of meter or cadence. 31 Consolidation is not content to come after; it is creative. The fact is that the beginning always begins in-between, intermezzo. Consistency is the same as consoli dation, it is the act that produces consolidated aggregates, of succession as well as of coexistence, by means of the three factors just mentioned: inter calated elements, intervals, and articulations of superposition. Architec ture, as the art of the abode and the territory, attests to this: there are consolidations that are made afterward, and there are consolidations of the keystone type that are constituent parts of the ensemble. More recently, matters like reinforced concrete have made it possible for the architectural ensemble to free itself from arborescent models employing tree-pillars, branch-beams, foliage-vaults. Not only is concrete a heterogeneous matter whose degree of consistency varies according to the elements in the mix, but iron is intercalated following a rhythm; moreover, its *self-supporting  surfaces *form a complex rhythmic personage whose "stems" have different sections and variable intervals depending on the intensity and direction of the force to be tapped (armature instead of structure). In this sense, the lit erary or musical work has an architecture: "Saturate every atom," as Vir ginia Woolf said; 32 or in the words of Henry James, it is necessary to "begin far away, as far away as possible," and to proceed by "blocks of wrought matter." It is no longer a question of imposing a form upon a matter but of elaborating an increasingly rich and consistent material, the better to tap increasingly intense forces. What makes a material increasingly rich is the same as what holds heterogeneities together without their ceasing to be het erogeneous. What holds them together in this way are intercalary oscilla tors, synthesizers with at least two heads; these are interval analyzers, rhythm synchronizers (the word "synchronizer" is ambiguous because molecular synchronizers do not proceed by homogenizing and equalizing measurement, but operate from within, between two rhythms). Is not con solidation the terrestrial name for consistency? The territorial assemblage is a milieu consolidation, a space-time consolidation, of coexistence and succession. And the refrain operates with these three factors. The matters of expression themselves must present characteristics mak ing this taking on of consistency possible. We have seen that they have an aptitude to enter into internal relations forming motifs and counterpoints: the territorializing marks become territorial motifs or counterpoints, the signatures and placards constitute a "style." These are the elements of a discrete or fuzzy aggregate; but they become consolidated, take on consis tency. To this extent, they have effects, such as reorganizing functions and gathering forces. To get a better grasp on the mechanism of this aptitude, we may lay down certain conditions of homogeneity, beginning with marks

0 330 □ 1837: OF THE REFRAIN or matters of the same kind, for example, a set of sonorous marks, the song of a bird. The song of the chaffinch normally has three distinct phases: the first has from four to fourteen notes rising in crescendo but decreasing in frequency; the second has from two to eight notes, lower than the first and of constant frequency; the third ends with a complex "flourish" or "orna ment." From the standpoint of acquisition, this "full song" is preceded by a "subsong" that under normal conditions already assumes possession of the general tonal quality, overall duration and content of the stanzas, and even a tendency to end on a higher note. 33 But the organization into three stan zas, the order of the stanzas, the details and the ornament, are not pregiven; it is precisely the articulations from within that are missing, the intervals, the intercalary notes, everything making for motif and counterpoint. The distinction between subsong and full song could thus be presented as fol lows: the subsong as mark or placard, the full song as style or motif, and the aptitude to pass from one to the other, for one to consolidate itself in the other. Clearly, artificial isolation will have very different effects depending on whether it takes place before or after the acquisition of the components ofthe subsong. Our present concern, however, is to find out what happens when these components effectively develop into the motifs and counterpoints of the full song. We must leave behind the conditions of qualitative homogeneity we set for ourselves. For as long as we confine ourselves to marks, marks of one kind coexist with marks of another kind, period: the sounds of an ani mal coexist with its colors, gestures, silhouettes; or else the sounds of a given species coexist with the sounds of other species, perhaps quite differ ent but close in space. The organization of qualified marks into motifs and counterpoints necessarily entails a taking on of consistency, or a capture of the marks of another quality, a mutual branching of sounds-colors-gestures, or a capture of sounds from different animal species, etc. Consistency necessarily occurs between heterogeneities, not because it is the birth of a differentiation, but because heterogeneities that were formerly content to coexist or succeed one another become bound up with one another through the "consolidation" of their coexistence and succession. The intervals, intercalations, and articulations constitutive of motifs and counterpoints in the order of an expressive quality also envelop other qualities of a different order, or qualities of the same order but of another sex or even another species of animal. A color will "answer to" a sound. If a quality has motifs and counterpoints, if there are rhythmic characters and melodic landscapes in a given order, then there is the constitution of a veritable *machinic opera *tying together orders, species, and heterogeneous qualities. What we term machinic is precisely this synthesis of heterogeneities as such. Inasmuch as these heterogeneities are matters of *expression, *we say

The varying relations into which a color, sound, gesture, movement, or position enters in the same species, and in different species, form so many machinic enunciations. Let us return to the stagemaker, the magic bird or bird of the opera. He is not brightly colored (as though there were an inhibition). But his song, his refrain, can be heard from a great distance (is this a compensation, or on the contrary the prime factor?). He sings perched on his singing stick, a vine or branch located just above the display ground he has prepared by marking it with cut leaves turned upside down to contrast with the color of the earth. As he sings, he uncovers the yellow root of certain feathers under neath his beak: he makes himself visible at the same time as sonorous. His song forms a varied and complex motif interweaving his own notes and those of other birds that he imitates in the intervals. 34 This produces a con solidation that "consists" in species-specific sounds, sounds of other spe cies, leaf hue, throat color: the stagemaker's machinic statement or assemblage of enunciation. Many birds "imitate" the songs of other spe cies. But imitation may not be the best concept for these phenomena, which vary according to the assemblage into which they enter. The subsong contains elements that can enter into melodic and rhythmic organizations distinct from those of the species under consideration, supplying the full song with truly alien or added notes. If certain birds such as the chaffinch seem impervious to imitation, it is because any alien sounds appearing in their subsong are eliminated from the consistency of the full song. On the other hand, in cases where added phrases do get included in the full song, it may be because there is an interspecific assemblage of the parasitism type; or it may be because the bird's assemblage itself effectuates the counter points to its melody. Thorpe is not wrong to say that the problem is one of the occupation of frequency bands, as with radios (the sound aspect of ter ritoriality). 35 It is less a question of imitating a song than of occupying cor responding frequencies; for there may be an advantage in being able to restrict oneself to a very determinate zone in some circumstances, and in others to widen or deepen the zone to assure oneself counterpoints and to invent chords that would otherwise remain diffuse, as, for example, in the rain forest, which is precisely where the greatest number of "imitative" birds are found. From the standpoint of consistency, matters of expression must be con sidered not only in relation to their aptitude to form motifs and counter points but also in relation to the inhibitors and releasers that act on them, and the mechanisms of innateness or learning, heredity or acquisition, that modulate them. Ethology's mistake is to restrict itself to a binary distri bution of these factors, even, and especially, when it is thought necessary to

0 332 □ 1837: OF THE REFRAIN take both into account simultaneously, to intermix them at every level of a "tree of behaviors." Instead, what should be done is to start from a positive notion capable of accounting for the very particular character the innate and the acquired assume in the rhizome, and which is like the principle of their mixture. Such a notion cannot be arrived at in terms of behavior but rather only in terms of assemblage. Some authors emphasize autonomous developments encoded in centers (innateness); others emphasize acquired linkages regulated by peripheral sensations (learning). But Raymond Ruyer has demonstrated that the animal is instead prey to "musical rhythms" and "melodic and rhythmic themes" explainable neither as the encoding of a recorded phonograph disk nor by the movements of per formance that effectuate them and adapt them to the circumstances. 36 The opposite is even true: the melodic or rhythmic themes precede their per formance and recording. What is primary is the consistency of a refrain, a little tune, either in the form of a mnemic melody that has no need to be inscribed locally in a center, or in the form of a vague motif with no need to be pulsed or stimulated. There is perhaps more to be learned from a musi cal and poetic notion such as the Natal—in the lied, or in Holderlin or Thomas Hardy—than from the slightly vapid and foggy categories of the innate and the acquired. For from the moment there is a territorial assem blage, we can say that the innate assumes a very particular figure, since it is inseparable from a movement of decoding and passes to the margins of the code, unlike the innate of the interior milieu; acquisition also assumes a very particular figure, since it is territorialized, in other words, regulated by matters of expression rather than by stimuli in the exterior milieu. The natal is the innate, but decoded; and it is the acquired, but territorialized. The natal is the new figure assumed by the innate and the acquired in the territorial assemblage. The affect proper to the natal, as heard in the lied: to be forever lost, or refound, or aspiring to the unknown homeland. In the natal, the innate tends to be displaced: as Ruyer says, it is in some way *prior  to *or *downstream from *the act; it concerns less the act or the behavior than the matters of expression themselves, the perception that discerns and selects them, and the gesture that erects them, or itself constitutes them (that is why there are "critical periods" when the animal valorizes an object or situation, "is impregnated" by a matter of expression, long before being able to perform the corresponding act). This is not to say, however, that behavior is at the mercy of chance learning; for it is predetermined by this displacement, and finds rules of assemblage in its own territorialization. The natal, then, consists in a decoding of innateness and a territo rialization of learning, one atop the other, one alongside the other. The natal has a consistency that cannot be explained as a mixture of the innate and the acquired, because it is instead what accounts for such mixtures in

0 1837: OF THE REFRAIN □ 333 territorial assemblage and interassemblages. In short, the notion of behav ior proves inadequate, too linear, in comparison with that of the assem blage. The natal stretches from what happens in the intra-assemblage all the way to the center that has been projected outside; it cuts across all the interassemblages and reaches all the way to the gates of the Cosmos. The territorial assemblage is inseparable from lines or coefficients of deterritorialization, passages, and relays toward other assemblages. There have been many studies on the influence of artificial conditions on bird song, but the results vary both by species and according to the kind and timing of the artifice. Many birds are receptive to the songs of other spe cies, if they are exposed to them during the critical period, and will repro duce the alien songs later on. The chaffinch, however, seems much more devoted to its own matters of expression and retains an innate sense of its own tonal quality even if exposed to synthetic sounds. The outcome also depends on whether the birds are isolated before or after the critical period. In the first case, chaffinches develop a nearly normal song; in the second, the subjects in the isolated group (who cannot hear each other) develop an abnormal, nonspecies-specific song that is nevertheless common to the group (see Thorpe). In any event, it is necessary to consider the effects of deterritorialization or denatalization on a given species at a given moment. Whenever a territorial assemblage is taken up by a movement that deterritorializes it (whether under so-called natural or artificial condi tions), we say that a machine is released. That in fact is the distinction we would like to propose between *machine *and *assemblage: *a machine is like a set of cutting edges that insert themselves into the assemblage undergoing deterritorialization, and draw variations and mutations of it. For there are no mechanical effects; effects are always machinic, in other words, depend on a machine that is plugged into an assemblage and has been freed through deterritorialization. What we call *machinic statements *are machine effects that define consistency or enter matters of expression. Effects of this kind can be very diverse but are never symbolic or imagi nary; they always have a real value of passage or relay. As a general rule, a machine plugs into the territorial assemblage of a species and opens it to other assemblages, causes it to pass through the interassemblages of that species; for example, the territorial assemblage of a bird species opens onto interassemblages of courtship and gregar-iousness, moving in the direction of the partner or "socius." But the machine may also open the territorial assemblage to interspecific assemblages, as in the case of birds that adopt alien songs, and most especially in the case of parasitism. 37 Or it may go beyond all assemblages and produce an opening onto the Cosmos. Or, conversely, instead of opening up the deterritorialized assemblage onto something else, it may produce an effect

0 334 □ 1837: OF THE REFRAIN of closure, as if the aggregate had fallen into and continues to spin in a kind of black hole. This is what happens under conditions of precocious or extremely sudden deterritorialization, and when specific, interspecific, and cosmic paths are blocked; the machine then produces "individual" group effects spinning in circles, as in the case of chaffinches that have been isolated too early, whose impoverished, simplified song expresses nothing more than the resonance of the black hole in which they are trapped. It is important to bring up this "black hole" function again because it can increase our understanding of phenomena of inhibition, and is in turn capable of breaking with the overnarrow inhibitor-releaser dualism. We saw earlier that an interassemblage could include lines of impoverishment and fixation leading to a black hole but could still perhaps lead into a richer and more positive line of deterritorialization (for example, the "grass stem" component among Australian grass finches falls into a black hole and leads into the "refrain" component). 38 Thus the black hole is a machine effect in assemblages and has a complex relation to other effects. It may be necessary for the release of innovative processes that they first fall into a catastrophic black hole: stases of inhibition are associated with the release of crossroads behaviors. On the other hand, when black holes resonate together or inhibitions conjugate and echo each other, instead of an opening onto consistency, we see a closure of the assemblage, as though it were deterritorialized in the void: young chaffinches. *Machines are  always singular keys that open or close an assemblage, a territory. *More over, finding the machine in operation in a given territorial assemblage is not enough; it is already in operation in the emergence of matters of expres sion, in other words, in the constitution of the assemblage and in the vec tors of deterritorialization that ply it from the start. Thus consistency of matters of expression relates, on the one hand, to their aptitude to form melodic and rhythmic themes and, on the other hand, to the power of the natal. Finally, there is one other aspect: their very special relation to the molecular (the machine starts us down this road). The very words, "matters of expression," imply that expression has a pri mary relation to matter. As matters of expression take on consistency they constitute semiotic systems, but the *semiotic *components are inseparable from *material *components and are in exceptionally close contact with molecular levels. The whole question is thus whether or not the molar-molecular relation assumes a new figure here. In general, it has been possible to distinguish "molar-molecular" combinations that vary greatly depending on the direction followed. First, individual atoms can enter into probabilistic or statistical accumulations that tend to efface their individu ality; this already happens on the level of the molecule, and then again in the molar aggregate. But they can become complicated in interactions and

In fact, it is always a question of popula tions; statistics concerns individual phenomena, and antistatistical indi viduality operates only in relation to molecular populations. The distinc tion is between two group movements, as in Alembert's equation, in which one group tends toward increasingly equilibrated, homogeneous, and probable states (the divergent wave and the delayed potential), and the other group tends toward less probable states of concentration (the conver gent wave and the anticipated potential). 40 Third, the intramolecular inter nal forces that give an aggregate its molar form can be of two types: they are either covalent, arborescent, mechanical, linear, localizable relations sub ject to chemical conditions of action and reaction or to linked reactions, or they are indirect, noncovalent, machinic and nonmechanical, superlinear, nonlocalizable bonds operating by stereospecific *discernment or discrimi-  nation, *rather than by linkage. 41 These are different ways of stating the same distinction, which seems much broader than the one we are looking for: it is, in effect, a distinction between matter and life, or rather, since there is only one matter, between two states, two tendencies of atomic matter (for example, there are bonds that immobilize the linked atoms in relation to one another, and other bonds that allow free rotation). Stating the distinction in the most general way, we could say that it is between stratified systems or systems of stratifi cation on the one hand, and consistent, self-consistent aggregates on the other. But the point is that consistency, far from being restricted to com plex life forms, fully pertains even to the most elementary atoms and parti cles. There is a coded system of stratification whenever, horizontally, there are linear causalities between elements; and, vertically, hierarchies of order between groupings; and, holding it all together in depth, a succession of framing forms, each of which informs a substance and in turn serves as a substance for another form. These causalities, hierarchies, and framings constitute a stratum, as well as the passage from one stratum to another, and the stratified combinations of the molecular and molar. On the other hand, we may speak of aggregates of consistency when instead of a regu lated succession of forms-substances we are presented with consolidations of very heterogeneous elements, orders that have been short-circuited or even reverse causalities, and captures between materials and forces of a dif ferent nature: as if a *machinic phylum, a destratifying transversality, *moved through elements, orders, forms and substances, the molar and the molec ular, freeing a matter and tapping forces. Now if we ask ourselves where life fits into this distinction, we see that it

0 336 D 1837: OF THE REFRAIN undoubtedly implies a gain in consistency, in other words, a surplus value (surplus value of *destratificatiori). *For example, it contains a greater num ber of self-consistent aggregates and processes of consolidation and gives them molar scope. It is destratifying from the outset, since its code is not distributed throughout the entire stratum but rather occupies an eminently specialized genetic line. But the question is almost contradictory, because asking where life fits in amounts to treating it as a particular stratum having its own order and befitting order, having its own forms and sub stances. It is true that it is both at once: a particularly complex system of stratification and an aggregate of consistency that disrupts orders, forms, and substances. As we have seen, the living thing performs a transcoding of milieus that can be considered both to constitute a stratum and to effect reverse causalities and transversals of destratification. The same question can be asked when life no longer restricts itself to mixing milieus but assembles territories as well. The territorial assemblage implies a *decoding * and is inseparable from its own *deterritorialization *(two new types of sur plus value). "Ethology" then can be understood as a very privileged molar domain for demonstrating how the most varied components (biochemical, behavioral, perceptive, hereditary, acquired, improvised, social, etc.) can crystallize in assemblages that respect neither the distinction between orders nor the hierarchy of forms. What holds all the components together are *transversals, *and the transversal itself is only a component that has taken upon itself the specialized vector of deterritorialization. In effect, what holds an assemblage together is not the play of framing forms or linear causalities but, actually or potentially, its most deterritorialized compo nent, a cutting edge of deterritorialization. An example is the refrain: it is more deterritorialized than the grass stem, but this does not preclude its being "determined," in other words, connected to biochemical and molec ular components. The assemblage holds by its most deterritorialized com ponent, but deterritorialized is not the same as indeterminate (the refrain may be narrowly connected to the presence of male hormones). 42 A compo nent of this kind entering an assemblage may be among the most highly determined, even mechanized, of components, but it will still bring "play" to what it composes; it fosters the entry of new dimensions of the milieus by releasing processes of discernibility, specialization, contraction, and accel eration that open new possibilities, that open the territorial assemblage onto interassemblages. Back to the stagemaker: one of its acts consists in discerning and causing to be discerned both sides of the leaf. This act is connected to the determinism of the "toothed" beak. Assemblages are defined simultaneously by *matters of expression *that take on consistency independently of the form-substance relation; reverse causalities or "advanced" determinisms, decoded innate functions related to *acts ofdis-*

But once again, this opposition is only relative, entirely relative. Just as milieus swing between a stratum state and a movement of destratification, assemblages swing between a territorial closure that tends to restratify them and a deterrito-rializing movement that on the contrary connects them with the Cosmos. Thus it is not surprising that the distinction we were seeking was not between assemblages and something else but between the two limits of any possible assemblage, in other words, between the system of strata and the plane of consistency. We should not forget that the strata rigidify and are organized on the plane of consistency, and that the plane of consistency is at work and is constructed in the strata, in both cases piece by piece, blow by blow, operation by operation. We have gone from stratified milieus to territorialized assemblages and simultaneously, from the forces of chaos, as broken down, coded, trans-coded by the milieus, to the forces of the earth, as gathered into the assemblages. Then we went from territorial assemblages to interassemblages, to' the opening of assemblages along lines of deterritorialization; and simultaneously, the same from the ingathered forces of the earth to the deterritorialized, or rather deterritorializing, Cosmos. How does Paul Klee present this last movement, which is not a terrestrial "pace" but instead a cosmic "breakaway" *[echappee: *also "opening," "outlet," "vista"; in counterpoint, "escape tone"—Trans.]? And why so enormous a word, Cosmos, to discuss an operation that must be precise? Klee says that one "tries convulsively to fly from the earth," and that one "rises above it. . . powered by centrifugal forces that triumph over gravity." He adds that the artist begins by looking around him- or herself, into all the milieus, but does so in order to grasp the trace of creation in the created, of naturing nature in natured nature; then, adopting "an earthbound position," 43 the artist turns his or her attention to the microscopic, to crystals, molecules, atoms, and particles, not for scientific conformity, but for movement, for nothing but immanent movement; the artist tells him- or herself that this world has had different aspects, will have still others, and that there are already others on other planets; finally, the artist opens up to the Cosmos in order to harness forces in a "work" (without which the opening onto the Cosmos would only be a reverie incapable of enlarging the limits of the earth); this work requires very simple, pure, almost childish means, but also the forces of a *people, * which is what is still lacking.

338 D 1837: OF THE REFRAIN We seek a people. We began over there in the Bauhaus.... More we cannot do." 44 Classicism refers to form-matter relation, or rather a form-substance relation (substance is precisely a matter endowed with form). Matter is organized by a succession of forms that are compartmentalized, central ized, and hierarchized in relation to one another, each of which takes charge of a greater or lesser amount of matter. Each form is like the code of a milieu, and the passage from one form to another is a veritable transcoding. Even the seasons are milieus. Two coexistent operations are involved, one by which the form differentiates itself according to binary distinctions, the other by which the formed substantial parts, milieus or seasons, enter into an order of succession that can be the same in either direction. But beneath these operations, the classical artist hazards an extreme and dangerous adventure. He or she breaks down the milieus, separates them, harmonizes them, regulates their mixtures, passes from one to the other. What the artist confronts in this way is chaos, the forces of chaos, the forces of a raw and untamed matter upon which Forms must be imposed in order to make substances, and Codes in order to make milieus. Phenomenal agility. That is why no one has ever been able to draw a clear line between baroque and classical. 45 All of baroque lies brewing beneath classicism: the task of the classical artist is God's own, that of organizing chaos; and the artist's only cry is Creation! Creation! The Tree of Creation! An ancient wooden flute organizes chaos, but chaos reigns like the Queen of the Night. The classical artist proceeds with a One-Two: the one-two of the differentiation of form divided (man-woman, masculine and feminine rhythms, voices, families of instru ments, all the binarities of the *ars nova); *and the one-two of the distinction between parts as they answer each other (the enchanted flute and the magic bell). The little tune, the bird refrain, is the binary unity of creation, the differentiating unity of the pure beginning: "At first the piano complained alone, like a bird deserted by its mate; the violin heard and answered it, as from a neighboring tree. It was as at the beginning of the world, as if there were as yet only the two of them on earth, *or rather*in this world closed to all the rest, fashioned by the logic of a creator, in which there would never be more than the two of them: this sonata." 46 If we attempt an equally summary definition of romanticism, we see that everything is clearly different. A new cry resounds: the Earth, the terri tory and the Earth! With romanticism, the artist abandons the ambition of de jure universality and his or her status as creator: the artist territorializes, enters a territorial assemblage. The seasons are now territorialized. The earth is certainly not the same thing as the territory. The earth is the intense point at the deepest level of the territory or is projected outside it like a

0 1837: OF THE REFRAIN D 339 focal point, where all the forces draw together in close embrace. The earth is no longer one force among others, nor is it a substance endowed with form or a coded milieu, with bounds and an apportioned share. The earth has become that close embrace of all forces, those of the earth as well as of other substances, so that the artist no longer confronts chaos, but hell and the subterranean, the groundless. The artist no longer risks dissipation in the milieus but rather sinking too deeply into the earth: Empedocles. The artist no longer identifies with Creation but with the ground or foundation, the foundation has become creative. The artist is no longer God but the Hero who defies God: Found, Found, instead of Create. Faust, especially the second Faust, is impelled by this tendency. Criticism, the Protestant ism of the earth, replaces dogmatism, the Catholicism of the milieus (code). It is certain that the Earth as an intense point in depth or in projec tion, as *ratio essendi, *is always in disjunction with the territory; and the ter ritory as the condition of "knowledge," *ratio cognoscendi, *is always in disjunction with the earth. The territory is German, the Earth Greek. And this disjunction is precisely what determines the status of the romantic art ist, in that she or he no longer confronts the gaping of chaos but the pull of the Ground *(Fond). *The little tune, the bird refrain, has changed: it is no longer the beginning of a world but draws a territorial assemblage upon the earth. It is then no longer made of two consonant parts that seek and answer one another; it addresses itself to a deeper singing that founds it, but also strikes against it and sweeps it away, making it ring dissonant. The refrain is indissolubly constituted by the territorial song and the singing of the earth that rises to drown it out. Thus at the end of *Das Lied von der Erde *(The song of the Earth) there are two coexistent motifs, one melodic, evoking the assemblages of the bird, the other rhythmic, evoking the deep, eternal breathing of the earth. Mahler says that the singing of the birds, the color of the flowers, and the fragrance of the forest are not enough to make Nature, that the god Dionysus and the great Pan are needed. The Ur-refrain of the earth harnesses all refrains whether territorial or not, and all milieu refrains. By the end of [Berg's] *Wozzeck, *the lullaby refrain, military refrain, drinking refrain, hunting refrain, child's refrain are so many admi rable assemblages swept up by the powerful earth machine and its cutting edges: Wozzeck's voice, by which the earth becomes sonorous, Marie's death cry moving over the pond, the repeated B note, when the earth howled ... It is owing to this disjunction, this decoding, that the romantic artist experiences the territory; but he or she experiences it as necessarily lost, and experiences him- or herself as an exile, a voyager, as deterrito-rialized, *driven back into the milieus, *like the Flying Dutchman or King Waldemar (whereas the classical artist inhabited the milieus). Yet this movement is still under earth's command, the repulsion from the territory

0 340 □ 1837: OF THE REFRAIN is produced by the attraction of the earth. The signpost now only indicates the road of no return. This is the ambiguity of the natal, as it appears in the lied (as well as in symphony and opera): the lied is simultaneously the terri tory, the lost territory, and the earth vector. The intermezzo assumed increasing importance because it played on all the disjunctions between the earth and the territory, inserted itself into them, filled them after its fashion, "between night and day," "noon-midnight." From this standpoint, the fundamental innovations of romanticism can be said to be the following: There were no longer substantial parts corresponding to forms, milieus corresponding to codes, or a matter in chaos given order in forms and by codes. The parts were instead like assemblages produced and dis mantled at the surface. Form itself became *a great form in continuous devel-  opment, *a gathering of the forces of the earth taking all the parts up into a sheaf. Matter itself was no longer a chaos to subjugate and organize but rather *the moving matter of a continuous variation. *The universal had become a relation, variation. The continuous variation of matter and the continuous development of form. The assemblages thus placed matter and form in a new relation: matter ceased to be a matter of content, becoming instead a matter of expression, and form ceased to be a code subduing the forces of chaos, becoming a force itself, the sum of the forces of the earth. There was a new relation to danger, madness, limits: romanticism did not go further than baroque classicism; it went elsewhere, with other givens and other vectors. What romanticism lacks most is a people. The territory is haunted by a solitary voice; the voice of the earth resonates with it and provides it per cussion rather than answering it. Even when there is a people, it is mediatized by the earth, it rises up from the bowels of the earth and is apt to return there: more a subterranean than a terrestrial people. The hero is a hero of the earth; he is mythic, rather than being a hero of the people and historical. Germany, German romanticism, had a genius for experiencing the natal territory not as deserted but as "solitary," regardless of popula tion density; for the population is only an emanation of the earth, and has the value of One Alone. The territory does not open onto a people, it half-opens onto the Friend, the Loved One; but the Loved One is already dead, and the Friend uncertain, disturbing. 47 As in the lied, everything in the territory occurs in relation to the One-Alone of the soul and the One-All of the earth. That is why romanticism takes on an entirely different aspect and even claims a different name, a different placard, in the Latin and Slavic countries, where on the contrary everything is put in terms of the theme of a people and the forces of a people. This time, it is the earth that is mediatized by the people, and exists only through the people. This time, the earth can be "deserted," an arid steppe, or a ravaged, dismembered ter

This time, the hero is a hero of the people, and not of the earth; her is related to the  *One-Crowd, *not the *One-All. *It certainly cannot be said that there is more or less nationalism on one side or the other because nationalism is everywhere in the figures of romanticism, sometimes as the driving force, sometimes as a black hole (fascism used Verdi much less than nazism did Wagner). The problem is a truly musical one, technically musical, and all the more politi cal for that. The romantic hero, the voice of the romantic hero, acts as a subject, a subjectified individual with "feelings"; but this subjective vocal element is reflected in an orchestral and instrumental whole that on the contrary mobilizes nonsubjective "affects" and that reaches its height in romanticism. It should not be thought that the vocal element and the orchestral-instrumental whole are only in an extrinsic relation to one another: the orchestration imposes a given role on the voice, and the voice envelops a given mode of orchestration. Orchestration-instrumentation brings sound forces together or separates them, gathers or disperses them; but it changes, and the role of the voice changes too, depending on whether the forces are of the Earth or of the People, of the One-All or the One-Crowd. In the first case, it is a question of effecting *grouping of powers, * and these are what constitute affects; in the second case, it is *group  individuations *that constitute affect and are the object of orchestration. Groupings of power are fully diversified, but they are like *the relations  proper to the Universal; *we must use another word, the *Dividual, *to desig nate the type of musical relations and the intra- or intergroup passages occurring in group individuation. The sentimental or subjective element of the voice has a different role and even a different position depending on whether it internally confronts nonsubjectified groupings of power or nonsubjectified group individuation, the relations of the universal or the relations of the "dividual." Debussy formulated the problem of the One-Crowd well when he reproached Wagner for not knowing how to "do" a crowd or a people: a crowd must be fully individuated, but by group individuations that are not reducible to the individuality of the subjects that compose the crowd. 48 The people must be individualized, not according to the persons within it, but according to the affects it experiences, simultaneously or successively. The concepts of the One-Crowd and the Dividual are botched if the people is reduced to a juxtaposition, or if it is reduced to a power of the universal. In short, there are two very different conceptions of orchestration, depending on whether one is seeking to sonorize the forces of the Earth or the forces of the People. The simplest example of this difference is doubtless Wagner-Verdi, in that Verdi puts increasing emphasis on the relations between the voice and instrumenta

0 342 D 1837: OF THE REFRAIN tion and orchestration. Even today, Stockhausen and Berio outline a new version of this difference, even though they are grappling with a musical problem different from that of romanticism (in Berio there is a search for a multiple cry, a cry of the population, in the dividual of the One-Crowd, and not for a cry of the Earth in the universal of the One-All). The idea of an Opera of the world, or cosmic music, changes drastically depending on which pole of orchestration is in play. 49 To avoid an oversimplified opposi tion between Wagner and Verdi, we would have to show how Berlioz had a genius for passing from one pole to the other in his orchestration, or even hesitating between them: a sonorous Nature *or *People. And how music like Mussorgsky's was able to do a crowd (despite what Debussy says). And how music like Bartok's was able to use popular, or population, airs to do popu lations, themselves sonorous, instrumental, and orchestral, which impose a Dividual scale, a prodigious new chromaticism. 50 And then there are all the non-Wagnerian paths ... If there is a modern age, it is, of course, the age of the cosmic. Paul Klee declared himself anti-Faustian. "As for animals and all the other creatures, I do not like them with a terrestrial cordiality; earthly things interest me less than cosmic things." The assemblage no longer confronts the forces of chaos, it no longer uses the forces of the earth or the people to deepen itself but instead opens onto the forces of the Cosmos. All this seems extremely general, and somewhat Hegelian, testifying to an absolute Spirit. Yet it is, should be, a question of technique, exclusively a question of technique. The essential relation is no longer matters-forms (or substances-attri butes); neither is it the continuous development of form and the continu ous variation of matter. It is now a direct relation *material-forces. *A material is a molecularized matter, which must accordingly "harness" forces; these forces are necessarily forces of the Cosmos. There is no longer a matter that finds its corresponding principle of intelligibility in form. It is now a question of elaborating a material charged with harnessing forces of a different order: the visual material must capture nonvisible forces. *Ren-  der visible, *Klee said; not render or reproduce the visible. From this per spective, philosophy follows the same movement as the other activities; whereas romantic philosophy still appealed to a formal synthetic identity ensuring a continuous intelligibility of matter (a priori synthesis), modern philosophy tends to elaborate a material of thought in order to capture forces that are not thinkable in themselves. This is Cosmos philosophy, after the manner of Nietzsche. The molecular material has even become so deterritorialized that we can no longer even speak of matters of expression, as we did in romantic territoriality. *Matters of expression are superseded by  a material of capture. *The forces to be captured are no longer those of the earth, which still constitute a great expressive Form, but the forces of an

0 1837: OF THE REFRAIN □ 343 immaterial, nonformal, and energetic Cosmos. The painter Millet used to say that what counts in painting is not, for example, what a peasant is carry ing, whether it is a sacred object or a sack of potatoes, but its exact weight. This is the postromantic turning point: the essential thing is no longer forms and matters, or themes, but forces, densities, intensities. The earth itself swings over, tending to take on the value of pure material for a force of gravitation or weight. Perhaps it is not until Cezanne that rocks begin to exist uniquely through the forces of folding they harness, landscapes through thermal and magnetic forces, and apples through forces of germi nation: nonvisual forces that nevertheless have been rendered visible. When forces become necessarily cosmic, material becomes necessarily molecular, with enormous force operating in an infinitesimal space. The problem is no longer that of the beginning, any more than it is that of a foundation-ground. It is now a problem of consistency or consolidation: how to consolidate the material, make it consistent, so that it can harness unthinkable, invisible, nonsonorous forces. Debussy ... Music molecu-larizes sound matter and in so doing becomes capable of harnessing nonsonorous forces such as Duration and Intensity. 51 *Render * *Duration sonorous. *Let us recall Nietzsche's idea of the eternal return as a little ditty, a refrain, but which captures the mute and unthinkable forces of the Cosmos. We thus leave behind the assemblages to enter the age of the Machine, the immense mechanosphere, the plane of cosmicization of forces to be harnessed. Varese's procedure, at the dawn of this age, is exemplary: a musical machine of consistency, a *sound machine *(not a machine for reproducing sounds), which molecularizes and atomizes, ionizes sound matter, and harnesses a cosmic energy. 52 If this machine must have an assemblage, it is the synthesizer. By assembling modules, source elements, and elements for treating sound (oscillators, generators, and transformers), by arranging microintervals, the synthesizer makes audible the sound process itself, the production of that process, and puts us in contact with still other elements beyond sound matter. 53 It unites disparate elements in the material, and transposes the parameters from one formula to another. The synthesizer, with its operation of consistency, has taken the place of the ground in a priori synthetic judgment: its synthesis is of the molecular and the cosmic, material and force, not form and matter, *Grund * and territory. Philosophy is no longer synthetic judgment; it is like a thought synthesizer functioning to make thought travel, make it mobile, make it a force of the Cosmos (in the same way as one makes sound travel). This synthesis of disparate elements is not without ambiguity. It has the same ambiguity, perhaps, as the modern valorization of children's draw ings, texts by the mad, and concerts of noise. Sometimes one overdoes it, puts too much in, works with a jumble of lines and sounds; then instead of

0 344 □ 1837: OF THE REFRAIN producing a cosmic machine capable of "rendering sonorous," one lapses back to a machine of reproduction that ends up reproducing nothing but a scribble effacing all lines, a scramble effacing all sounds. The claim is that one is opening music to all events, all irruptions, but one ends up reproduc ing a scrambling that prevents any event from happening. All one has left is a resonance chamber well on the way to forming a black hole. A material that is too rich remains too "territorialized": on noise sources, on the nature of the objects ... (this even applies to Cage's prepared piano). One makes an aggregate fuzzy, instead of defining the fuzzy aggregate *by *the operations of consistency or consolidation pertaining to it. For this is the essential thing: *a fuzzy aggregate, a synthesis of disparate elements, is  defined only by a degree of consistency that makes it possible to distinguish  the disparate elements constituting that aggregate (discernibility) *, 54 The material must be sufficiently deterritorialized to be molecularized and open onto something cosmic, instead of lapsing into a statistical heap. This condition is met only if there is a certain simplicity in the nonuniform material: a maximum of calculated sobriety in relation to the disparate ele ments and the parameters. The sobriety of the assemblages is what makes for the richness of the Machine's effects. People often have too much of a tendency to reterritorialize on the child, the mad, noise. If this is done, one  *fuzzifies *instead of making the fuzzy aggregate consist, or harnessing cos mic forces in the deterritorialized material. That is why it infuriated Paul Klee when people would talk about the "childishness" of his drawings (and Varese when they would talk about sound effects, etc.). According to Klee, what is needed in order to "render visible" or harness the Cosmos is a pure and simple line accompanied by the idea of an object, and nothing more: if you multiply the lines and take the whole object, you get nothing but a scramble, and visual sound effects. 55 According to Varese, in order for the projection to yield a highly complex form, in other words, a cosmic distri bution, what is necessary is a simple figure in motion and a plane that is itself mobile; otherwise, you get sound effects. Sobriety, sobriety: that is the common prerequisite for the deterritorialization of matters, the molecu-larization of material, and the cosmicization of forces. Maybe a child can do that. But the sobriety involved is the sobriety of a becoming-child that is not necessarily the becoming o/the child, quite the contrary; the becoming-mad involved is not necessarily the becoming *of * 'the madman, quite the contrary. It is clear that what is necessary to make sound travel, and to travel around sound, is very pure and simple sound, an emission or wave without harmonics (La Monte Young has been successful at this). The more rarefied the atmosphere, the more disparate the elements you will find. Your synthesis of disparate elements will be all the *stronger *if you proceed with a sober gesture, an act of consistency, capture, or extraction that

0 1837: OF THE REFRAIN □ 345 works in a material that is not meager but prodigiously simplified, crea tively limited, selected. For there is no imagination outside of technique. The modern figure is not the child or the lunatic, still less the artist, but the cosmic artisan: a homemade atomic bomb—it's very simple really, it's been proven, it's been done. To be an artisan and no longer an artist, cre ator, or founder, is the only way to become cosmic, to leave the milieus and the earth behind. The invocation to the Cosmos does not at all operate as a metaphor; on the contrary, the operation is an effective one, from the moment the artist connects a material with forces of consistency or consolidation. Material thus has three principal characteristics: it is a molecularized matter; it has a relation to forces to be harnessed; and it is defined by the operations of consistency applied to it. Finally, it is clear that the relation to the earth and the people has changed, and is no longer of the romantic type. The earth is now at its most deterritorialized: not only a point in a galaxy, but one galaxy among others. The people is now at its most molecularized: a molecular population, a people of oscillators as so many forces of interac tion. The artist discards romantic figures, relinquishes both the forces of the earth and those of the people. The combat, if combat there is, has moved. The established powers have occupied the earth, they have built people's organizations. The mass media, the great people's organizations of the party or union type, are machines for reproduction, fuzzification machines that effectively scramble all the terrestrial forces of the people. The established powers have placed us in the situation of a combat at once atomic and cosmic, galactic. Many artists became aware of this situation long ago, even before it had been installed (Nietzsche, for example). They became aware of it because the same vector was traversing their own domain: a molecularization, an atomization of the material, coupled with a cosmicization of the forces taken up by that material. The question then became whether molecular or atomic "populations" of all natures (mass media, monitoring procedures, computers, space weapons) would con tinue to bombard the existing people in order to train it or control it or annihilate it—or if other molecular populations were possible, could slip into the first and give rise to a people yet to come. As Virilio says in his very rigorous analysis of the depopulation of the people and the deterrito-rialization of the earth, the question has become: "To dwell as a poet or as an assassin?" 56 The assassin is one who bombards the existing people with molecular populations that are forever closing all of the assemblages, hurling them into an ever wider and deeper black hole. The poet, on the other hand, is one who lets loose molecular populations in hopes that this will sow the seeds of, or even engender, the people to come, that these populations will pass into a people to come, open a cosmos.

In this respect, the relation of artists to the people has changed significantly: the artist has ceased to be the One-Alone withdrawn into him- or herself, but has also ceased to address the people, to invoke the people as a constituted force. Never has the artist been more in need of a people, while stating most firmly that the people is lacking—the people is what is most lacking. We are not referring to popular or populist artists. Mallarme said that the Book needed a people. Kafka said that literature is the affair of the people. Klee said that the people is essential *yet lacking. *Thus the problem of the artist is that the modern depopulation of the people results in an open earth, and by means of art, or by means to which art contributes. Instead of being bom barded from all sides in a limiting cosmos, the people and the earth must be like the vectors of a cosmos that carries them off; then the cosmos itself will be art. From depopulation, make a cosmic people; from deterritorializa-tion, a cosmic earth—that is the wish of the artisan-artist, here, there, locally. Our governments deal with the molecular and the cosmic, and our arts make them their affair also, with the same stakes, the people and the earth, and with unfortunately incomparable, but nevertheless competitive, means. Is it not of the nature of creations to operate in silence, locally, to seek consolidation everywhere, to go from the molecular to an uncertain cosmos, whereas the processes of destruction and conservation work in bulk, take center stage, occupy the entire cosmos in order to enslave the molecular and to stick it in a conservatory or a bomb? These three "ages," the classical, romantic, and modern (for lack of a better term), should not be interpreted as an evolution, or as structures sep arated by signifying breaks. They are assemblages enveloping different Machines, or different relations to the Machine. In a sense, everything we attribute to an age was already present in the preceding age. Forces, for example: it has always been a question of forces, designated either as forces of chaos or forces of the earth. Similarly, for all of time painting has had the project of rendering visible, instead of reproducing the visible, and music of rendering sonorous, instead of reproducing the sonorous. Fuzzy aggre gates have been constituting themselves and inventing their processes of consolidation all along. *A freeing of the molecular *was already found in classical matters of content, operating by destratification, and in romantic matters of expression, operating by decoding. The most we can say is that when forces appear as forces of the earth or of chaos, they are not grasped directly as forces but as reflected in relations between matter and form. Thus it is more a question of thresholds of perception, or thresholds of

It is only after matter has been sufficiently deterritorialized that it itself emerges as molecular and brings forth pure forces attributable only to the Cosmos. It had been pres ent "for all of time," but under different perceptual conditions. New condi tions were necessary for what was buried or covered, inferred or con cluded, presently to rise to the surface. What was composed in an assemblage, what was still only composed, becomes a component of a new assemblage. In this sense, all history is really the history of perception, and what we make history with is the matter of a becoming, not the subject mat ter of a story. Becoming is like the machine: present in a different way in every assemblage, passing from one to the other, opening one onto the other, outside any fixed order or determined sequence. We are now ready to return to the refrain. We can propose a new classifi cation system: milieu refrains, with at least two parts, one of which answers the other (the piano and the violin); natal refrains, refrains of the territory, where the part is related to the whole, to an immense refrain of the earth, according to relations that are themselves variable and mark in each instance the disjunction between the earth and the territory (the lullaby, the drinking song, hunting song, work song, military song, etc.); folk and popular refrains, themselves tied to an immense song of the people, according to variable relations of crowd individuations that simultane ously bring into play affects and nations (the Polish, Auvergnat, German, Magyar, or Romanian, but also the Pathetic, Panicked, Vengeful, etc.); molecularized refrains (the sea and the wind) tied to cosmic forces, the Cosmos refrain. For the Cosmos itself is a refrain, and the ear also (every thing that has been taken for a labyrinth is in fact a refrain). But precisely why is the refrain eminently sonorous? Why this privileging of the ear, when even animals and birds present us with so many visual, chromatic, postural, and gestural refrains? Does the painter have fewer refrains than the musician? Are there fewer refrains in Cezanne or Klee than in Mozart, Schumann, or Debussy? Taking Proust's examples: Does Vermeer's little yellow span of wall, or a painter's flowers, Elstir's roses, constitute less of a refrain than Vinteuil's little phrase? There is surely no question here of declaring a given art supreme on the basis of a formal hierarchy of absolute criteria. Our problem is more modest: comparing the powers or coeffi cients of deterritorialization of sonorous and visual components. It seems that when sound deterritorializes, it becomes more and more refined; it becomes specialized and autonomous. Color clings more, not necessarily to the object, but to territoriality. When it deterritorializes, it tends to dissolve, to let itself be steered by other components. This is evident in phenomena of synesthesia, which are not reducible to a simple color-sound correspondence; sounds have a piloting role and induce colors that *are*

But this does not happen without great ambiguity: sound invades us, impels us, drags us, transpierces us. It takes leave of the earth, as much in order to drop us into a black hole as to open us up to a cosmos. It makes us want to die. Since its force of deterritorialization is the strongest, it also effects the most massive of reterritorializations, the most numbing, the most redundant. Ecstasy and hypnosis. Colors do not move a people. Flags can do nothing without trumpets. Lasers are modulated on sound. The refrain is sonorous par excellence, but it can as easily develop its force into a sickly sweet ditty as into the purest motif, or Vinteuil's little phrase. And sometimes the two combine: Beethoven used as a "signature tune." The potential fascism of music. Overall, we may say that music is plugged into a machinic phylum infinitely more powerful than that of painting: a line of selective pressure. That is why the musician has a different relation to the people, machines, and the established powers than does the painter. In particular, the estab lished powers feel a keen need to control the distribution of black holes and lines of deterritorialization in this phylum of sounds, in order to ward off or appropriate the effects of musical machinism. Painters, at least as com monly portrayed, may be much more open socially, much more political, and less controlled from without and within. That is because each time they paint, they must create or recreate a phylum, and they must do so on the basis of bodies of light and color they themselves produce, whereas musicians have at their disposal a kind of germinal continuity, even if it is latent or indirect, on the basis of which they produce sound bodies. Two different movements of creation: one goes from *soma *to *germen, *and the other from *germen *to *soma. *The painter's refrain is like the flipside of the musician's, a negative of music. So just what is a refrain? *Glass harmonica: *the refrain is a prism, a crys tal of space-time. It acts upon that which surrounds it, sound or light, extracting from it various vibrations, or decompositions, projections, or transformations. The refrain also has a catalytic function: not only to increase the speed of the exchanges and reactions in that which surrounds it, but also to assure indirect interactions between elements devoid of so-called natural affinity, and thereby to form organized masses. The refrain is therefore of the crystal or protein type. The seed, or internal structure, then has two essential aspects: augmentations and diminutions, additions and withdrawals, amplifications and eliminations by unequal

The strange ret rograde motion *of Joke. *It is of the nature of the refrain to become concentrated by elimination in a very short moment, as though moving from the extremes to a center, or, on the contrary, to develop by additions, moving from a center to the extremes, and also to travel these routes in both directions. 58 The refrain fabricates time *(du temps). *The refrain is the "implied tense" *(temps) *discussed by the linguist Gustave Guillaume. The ambiguity of the refrain is more evident now: for if the retrograde motion merely forms a closed circle, if the augmentations and diminutions are reg ular, proceeding, for example, by doubled or halved values, then this false spatiotemporal rigor leaves the exterior aggregate all the fuzzier; that aggregate now has only descriptive, indicative, or associative relations with the seed. It is "a worksite of inauthentic elements for the formation of impure crystals," rather than a pure crystal that harnesses cosmic forces. The refrain remains a formula evoking a character or landscape, instead of itself constituting a rhythmic character or melodic landscape. The refrain has two poles. These poles hinge not only on an intrinsic quality but also on a state of force on the part of the listener; thus the little phrase from Vinteuil's sonata is associated with Swann's love, the character of Odette, and the landscape of the Bois de Boulogne for a long time, until it turns back on itself, opens onto itself, revealing until then unheard-of potentiali ties, entering into other connections, setting love adrift in the direction of other assemblages. Here, Time is not an a priori form; rather, the refrain is the a priori form of time, which in each case fabricates different times  *[temps: *also, "meters," "tempos"—Trans.]. It is odd how music does not eliminate the bad or mediocre refrain, or the bad usage of the refrain, but on the contrary carries it along, or uses it as a springboard. "Ah, vous dirai-je maman" ("Ah, mamma, now you shall know"), "Elle avait une jambe de bois" ("She had a wooden leg"), "Frere Jacques." Childhood or bird refrain, folk song, drinking song, Viennese waltz, cow bells: music uses anything and sweeps everything away. Not that a folk song, bird song, or children's song is reducible to the kind of closed and associative formula we just mentioned. Instead, what needs to be shown is that a musician requires a *first type *of refrain, a territorial or assemblage refrain, in order to transform it from within, deterritorialize it, producing a refrain of the *second type *as the final end of music: the cosmic refrain of a sound machine. Gisele Brelet, discussing Bartok, gives a good formulation of the problem of the two types: beginning from popular and territorial *melodies *that are autonomous, self-sufficient, and closed in upon themselves, how can one construct a new chromaticism that places them in communication, thereby creating *"themes" *bringing about a devel

The problem is a general one because in many directions refrains will be planted by a new seed that brings back modes, makes those modes communicate, undoes tempera ment, melds major and minor, and cuts the tonal system loose, slipping through its net instead of breaking with it. 59 We may say long live Chabrier, as opposed to Schoenberg, just as Nietzsche said long live Bizet, and for the same reasons, with the same technical and musical intent. We go from modality to an untempered, widened chromaticism. We do not need to suppress tonality, we need to turn it loose. We go from assembled refrains (territorial, popular, romantic, etc.) to the great cosmic machined refrain. But the labor of creation is already under way in the first type; it is there in its entirety. Deformations destined to harness a great force are already present in the small-form refrain or rondo. Childhood scenes, children's games: the starting point is a childlike refrain, but the child has wings already, he becomes celestial. The becoming-child of the musician is cou pled with a becoming-aerial of the child, in a nondecomposable block. The memory of an angel, or rather the becoming of a cosmos. Crystal: the becoming-bird of Mozart is inseparable from a becoming-initiate of the bird, and forms a block with it. 60 It is the extremely profound labor dedi cated to the first type of refrain that creates the second type, or the little phrase of the Cosmos. In a concerto, Schumann requires all the assem blages of the orchestra to make the cello wander the way a light fades into the distance or is extinguished. In Schumann, a whole learned labor, at once rythmic, harmonic, and melodic, has this sober and simple result:  *deterritorialize the refrain.* *61* * *Produce a deterritorialized refrain as the final end of music, release it in the Cosmos—that is more important than build ing a new system. Opening the assemblage onto a cosmic force. In the pas sage from one to the other, from the assemblage of sounds to the Machine that renders it sonorous, from the becoming-child of the musician to the becoming-cosmic of the child, many dangers crop up: black holes, closures, paralysis of the finger and auditory hallucinations, Schumann's madness, cosmic force gone *bad, *a note that pursues you, a sound that transfixes you. Yet one was already present in the other; the cosmic force was already pres ent in the material, the great refrain in the little refrains, the great maneu ver in the little maneuver. Except we can never be sure we will be strong enough, for we have no system, only lines and movements. Schumann.

A XIOM I. *The war machine is exterior to the State apparatus. * P ROPOSITION I. *This exteriority is first attested to in mythology, epic, * *drama, and games.* Georges Dumezil, in his definitive analyses of Indo-European mythology, has shown that political sovereignty, or domination, has two heads: the magician-king and the jurist-priest. Rex and flamen, raj and Brahman, Romulus and Numa, Varuna and Mitra, the despot and the legislator, the binder and the organizer. Undoubtedly, these two poles stand in opposi tion term by term, as the obscure and the clear, the violent and the calm, the quick and the weighty, the fearsome and the regulated, the "bond" and the "pact," etc.' But their opposition is only relative; they function as a pair, in alternation, as though they expressed a division of the One or constituted in themselves a sovereign unity.

0 352 □ 1227: TREATISE ON NOMADOLOGY—THE WAR MACHINE mythology of conflict: a specification on any one level automatically calls forth a homologous specification on another. The two together exhaust the field of the function." They are the principal elements of a State apparatus that proceeds by a One-Two, distributes binary distinctions, and forms a milieu of interiority. It is a double articulation that makes the State appara tus into a *stratum.* It will be noted that war is not contained within this apparatus. *Either * the State has at its disposal a violence that is not channeled through war— either it uses police officers and jailers in place of warriors, has no arms and no need of them, operates by immediate, magical capture, "seizes" and "binds," preventing all combat—*or, *the State acquires an army, but in a way that presupposes a juridical integration of war and the organization of a military function. 2 As for the war machine in itself, it seems to be irreduc ible to the State apparatus, to be outside its sovereignty and prior to its law: it comes from elsewhere. *Indra, the warrior god, is in opposition to Varuna  no less than to Mitra? *He can no more be reduced to one or the other than he can constitute a third of their kind. Rather, he is like a pure and immeas urable multiplicity, the pack, an irruption of the ephemeral and the power of metamorphosis. *He unties the bond just as he betrays the pact. *He brings  *a furor to *bear against sovereignty, a celerity against gravity, secrecy against the public, a power *(puissance) *against sovereignty, a machine against the apparatus. He bears witness to another kind of justice, one of incompre hensible cruelty at times, but at others of unequaled pity as well (because he unties bonds.. .). 4 He bears witness, above all, to other relations with women, with animals, because he sees all things in relations of *becoming, * rather than implementing binary distributions between "states": a verita ble becoming-animal of the warrior, a becoming-woman, which lies out side dualities of terms as well as correspondences between relations. In every respect, the war machine is of another species, another nature, another origin than the State apparatus. Let us take a limited example and compare the war machine and the State apparatus in the context of the theory of games. Let us take chess and Go, from the standpoint of the game pieces, the relations between the pieces and the space involved. Chess is a game of State, or of the court: the emperor of China played it. Chess pieces are coded; they have an internal nature and intrinsic properties from which their movements, situations, and confrontations derive. They have qualities; a knight remains a knight, a pawn a pawn, a bishop a bishop. Each is like a subject of the statement endowed with a relative power, and these relative powers combine in a sub ject of enunciation, that is, the chess player or the game's form of interiority. Go pieces, in contrast, are pellets, disks, simple arithmetic units, and have only an anonymous, collective, or third-person function:

0 1227: TREATISE ON NOMADOLOGY—THE WAR MACHINE □ 353 "It" makes a move. "It" could be a man, a woman, a louse, an elephant. Go pieces are elements of a nonsubjectified machine assemblage with no intrinsic properties, only situational ones. Thus the relations are very dif ferent in the two cases. Within their milieu of interiority, chess pieces entertain biunivocal relations with one another, and with the adversary's pieces: their functioning is structural. On the other hand, a Go piece has only a milieu of exteriority, or extrinsic relations with nebulas or constella tions, according to which it fulfills functions of insertion or situation, such as bordering, encircling, shattering. All by itself, a Go piece can destroy an entire constellation synchronically; a chess piece cannot (or can do so diachronically only). Chess is indeed a war, but an institutionalized, regu lated, coded war, with a front, a rear, battles. But what is proper to Go is war without battle lines, with neither confrontation nor retreat, without battles even: pure strategy, whereas chess is a semiology. Finally, the space is not at all the same: in chess, it is a question of arranging a closed space for oneself, thus of going from one point to another, of occupying the maximum num ber of squares with the minimum number of pieces. In Go, it is a question of arraying oneself in an open space, of holding space, of maintaining the possibility of springing up at any point: the movement is not from one point to another, but becomes perpetual, without aim or destination, with out departure or arrival. The "smooth" space of Go, as against the "stri ated" space of chess. The *nomos *of Go against the State of chess, *nomos * against *polis. *The difference is that chess codes and decodes space, whereas Go proceeds altogether differently, territorializing or deterritorializing it (make the outside a territory in space; consolidate that territory by the con struction of a second, adjacent territory; deterritorialize the enemy by shattering his territory from within; deterritorialize oneself by renouncing, by going elsewhere . ..). Another justice, another movement, another space-time. "They come like fate, without reason, consideration, or pretext. . ." "In some way that is incomprehensible they have pushed right into the capital. At any rate, here they are; it seems that every morning there are more of them." 5 Luc de Heusch analyzes a Bantu myth that leads us to the same schema: Nkongolo, an indigenous emperor and administrator of public works, a man of the public and a man of the police, gives his half-sisters to the hunter Mbidi, who assists him and then leaves. Mbidi's son, a man of secrecy, joins up with his father, only to return from the outside with that inconceivable thing, an army. He kills Nkongolo and proceeds to build a new State. 6 "Between" the magical-despotic State and the juridical State containing a military institution, we see the flash of the war machine, arriv ing from without.

0 354 □ 1227: TREATISE ON NOMADOLOGY—THE WAR MACHINE eccentricity, necessarily appears in a negative form: stupidity, deformity, madness, illegitimacy, usurpation, sin. Dumezil analyzes the three "sins" of the warrior in the Indo-European tradition: against the king, against the priest, against the laws originating in the State (for example, a sexual trans gression that compromises the distribution of men and women, or even a betrayal of the laws of war as instituted by the State). 7 The warrior is in the position of betraying everything, including the function of the military, *or * of understanding nothing. It happens that historians, both bourgeois and Soviet, will follow this negative tradition and explain how Genghis Khan understood nothing: he "didn't understand" the phenomenon of the city. An easy thing to say. The problem is that the exteriority of the war machine in relation to the State apparatus is everywhere apparent but remains diffi cult to conceptualize. It is not enough to affirm that the war machine is external to the apparatus. It is necessary to reach the point of conceiving the war machine as itself a pure form of exteriority, whereas the State appa ratus constitutes the form of interiority we habitually take as a model, or according to which we are in the habit of thinking. What complicates everything is that this extrinsic power of the war machine tends, under cer tain circumstances, to become confused with one of the two heads of the State apparatus. Sometimes it is confused with the magic violence of the State, at other times with the State's military institution. For instance, the war machine invents speed and secrecy; but there is all the same a certain speed and a certain secrecy that pertain to the State, relatively, secondarily. So there is a great danger of identifying the structural relation between the two poles of political sovereignty, and the dynamic interrelation of these two poles, with the power of war. Dumezil cites the lineage of the Roman kings: there is a Romulus-Numa relation that recurs throughout a series, with variants and an alternation between these two types of equally legiti mate rulers; but there is also a relation with an "evil king," Tullus Hostilius, Tarquinius Superbus, an upsurge of the warrior as a disquieting and illegit imate character. 8 Shakespeare's kings could also be invoked: even violence, murders, and perversion do not prevent the State lineage from producing "good" kings; but a disturbing character like Richard III slips in, announc ing from the outset his intention to reinvent a war machine and impose its line (deformed, treacherous and traitorous, he claims a "secret close intent" 9 totally different from the conquest of State power, and another —an *other*—relation with women). In short, whenever the irruption of war power is confused with the line of State domination, everything gets mud dled; the war machine can then be understood only through the categories of the negative, since nothing is left that remains outside the State. But, returned to its milieu of exteriority, the war machine is seen to be of another species, of another nature, of another origin. One would have to

0 1227: TREATISE ON NOMADOLOGY—THE WAR MACHINE □ 355 say that it is located between the two heads of the State, between the two articulations, and that it is necessary in order to pass from one to the other. But "between" the two, in that instant, even ephemeral, if only a flash, it proclaims its own irreducibility. *The State has no war machine of its own; *it can only appropriate one in the form of a military institution, one that will continually cause it problems. This explains the mistrust States have toward their military institutions, in that the military institution inherits an extrinsic war machine. Karl von Clausewitz has a general sense of this situation when he treats the flow of absolute war as an Idea that States par tially appropriate according to their political needs, and in relation to which they are more or less good "conductors." Trapped between the two poles of political sovereignty, the man of war seems outmoded, condemned, without a future, reduced to his own fury, which he turns against himself. The descendants of Hercules, Achilles, then Ajax, have enough strength left to proclaim their independence from Agamemnon, a man of the old State. But they are powerless when it comes to Ulysses, a man of the nascent modern State, the first man of the modern State. And it is Ulysses who inherits Achilles' arms, only to convert them to other uses, submitting them to the laws of the State—not Ajax, who is con demned by the goddess he defied and against whom he sinned. 10 No one has portrayed the situation of the man of war, at once eccentric and con demned, better than Kleist. In *Penthesilea, *Achilles is already separated from his power: the war machine has passed over to the Amazons, a State less woman-people whose justice, religion, and loves are organized uniquely in a war mode. Descendants of the Scythians, the Amazons spring forth like lightning, "between" the two States, the Greek and the Trojan. They sweep away everything in their path. Achilles is brought before his double, Penthesilea. And in his ambiguous struggle, Achilles is unable to prevent himself from marrying the war machine, or from loving Penthe silea, and thus from betraying Agamemnon and Ulysses at the same time. Nevertheless, he already belongs enough to the Greek State that Pen thesilea, for her part, cannot enter the passional relation of war with him without herself betraying the collective law of her people, the law of the pack that prohibits "choosing" the enemy and entering into one-to-one relationships or binary distinctions. Throughout his work, Kleist celebrates the war machine, setting it against the State apparatus in a struggle that is lost from the start. Doubt less Arminius heralds a Germanic war machine that breaks with the imper ial order of alliances and armies, and stands forever opposed to the Roman State. But the Prince of Homburg lives only in a dream and stands con demned for having reached victory in disobedience of the law of the State. As for Kohlhaas, his war machine can no longer be anything more than

0 356 □ 1227: TREATISE ON NOMADOLOGY—THE WAR MACHINE banditry. Is it the destiny of the war machine, when the State triumphs, to be caught in this alternative: either to be nothing more than the disci plined, military organ of the State apparatus, *or to turn against itself, *to become a double suicide machine for a solitary man and a solitary woman? Goethe and Hegel, State thinkers both, see Kleist as a monster, and Kleist has lost from the start. Why is it, then, that the most uncanny modernity lies with him? It is because the elements of his work are secrecy, speed, and affect.'' And in Kleist the secret is no longer a content held within a form of interiority; rather, it becomes a form, identified with the form of exteriority that is always external to itself. Similarly, feelings become uprooted from the interiority of a "subject," to be projected violently out ward into a milieu of pure exteriority that lends them an incredible veloc ity, a catapulting force: love or hate, they are no longer feelings but affects. And these affects are so many instances of the becoming-woman, the becoming-animal of the warrior (the bear, she-dogs). Affects transpierce the body like arrows, they are weapons of war. The deterritorialization velocity of affect. Even dreams (Homburg's, Pentheselea's) are externa lized, by a system of relays and plug-ins, extrinsic linkages belonging to the war machine. Broken rings. This element of exteriority—which dominates everything, which Kleist invents in literature, which he is the first to invent—will give time a new rhythm: an endless succession of catatonic episodes or fainting spells, and flashes or rushes. Catatonia is: "This affect is too strong for me," and a flash is: "The power of this affect sweeps me away," so that the Self *(Moi) *is now nothing more than a character whose actions and emotions are desubjectified, perhaps even to the point of death. Such is Kleist's personal formula: a succession of flights of madness and catatonic freezes in which no subjective interiority remains. There is much of the East in Kleist: the Japanese fighter, interminably still, who then makes a move too quick to see. The Go player. Many things in modern art come from Kleist. Goethe and Hegel are old men next to Kleist. Could it be that it is at the moment the war machine ceases to exist, conquered by the State, that it displays to the utmost its irreducibility, that it scatters into thinking, loving, dying, or creating machines that have at their disposal vital or revolutionary powers capable of challenging the conquering State? Is the war machine already overtaken, condemned, appropriated as part of the same process whereby it takes on new forms, undergoes a metamorpho sis, affirms its irreducibility and exteriority, and deploys that milieu of pure exteriority that the occidental man of the State, or the occidental thinker, continually reduces to something other than itself?

0 1227: TREATISE ON NOMADOLOGY—THE WAR MACHINE □ 357 P ROPOSITION II. *The exteriority of the war machine is also attested to by * *ethnology (a tribute to the memory of Pierre Clastres).* Primitive, segmentary societies have often been defined as societies without a State, in other words, societies in which distinct organs of power  do not appear. But the conclusion has been that these societies did not  reach the degree of economic development, or the level of political differ-  entiation, that would make the formation of the State apparatus both  possible and inevitable: the implication is that primitive people "don't  understand" so complex an apparatus. The prime interest in Pierre  Clastres's theories is that they break with this evolutionist postulate. Not  only does he doubt that the State is the product of an ascribable economic  development, but he asks if it is not a potential concern of primitive socie-  ties to ward off or avert that monster they supposedly do not understand.  Warding off the formation of a State apparatus, making such a formation  impossible, would be the objective of a certain number of primitive social  mechanisms, even if they are not consciously understood as such. To be  sure, primitive societies have *chiefs. *But the State is not defined by the exis-  tence of chiefs; it is defined by the perpetuation or conservation of organs  of power. The concern of the State is to conserve. Special institutions are  thus necessary to enable a chief to become a man of State, but diffuse, col-  lective mechanisms are just as necessary to prevent a chief from becoming  one. Mechanisms for warding off, preventive mechanisms, are a part of  chieftainship and keep an apparatus distinct from the social body from  crystallizing. Clastres describes the situation of the chief, who has no insti-  tuted weapon other than his prestige, no other means of persuasion, no  other rule than his sense of the group's desires. The chief is more like a  leader or a star than a man of power and is always in danger of being disa-  vowed, abandoned by his people. But Clastres goes further, identifying *war  *in primitive societies as the surest mechanism directed against the forma-  tion of the State: war maintains the dispersal and segmentarity of groups,  and the warrior himself is caught in a process of accumulating exploits  leading him to solitude and a prestigious but powerless death. 12 Clastres can thus invoke natural Law while reversing its principal proposition: just  as Hobbes saw clearly that *the State was against war, so war is against the  State, *and makes it impossible. It should not be concluded that war is a  state of nature, but rather that it is the mode of a social state that wards off  and prevents the State. Primitive war does not produce the State any more  than it derives from it. And it is no better explained by exchange than by  the State: far from deriving from exchange, even as a sanction for its fail-  ure, war is what limits exchanges, maintains them in the framework of

0 358 □ 1227: TREATISE ON NOMADOLOGY—THE WAR MACHINE "alliances"; it is what prevents them from becoming a State factor, from fusing groups. The importance of this thesis is first of all to draw attention to collective mechanisms of inhibition. These mechanisms may be subtle, and function as micromechanisms. This is easily seen in certain band or pack phenom ena. For example, in the case of gangs of street children in Bogota, Jacques Meunier cites three ways in which the leader is prevented from acquiring stable power: the members of the band meet and undertake their theft activity in common, with collective sharing of the loot, but they disperse to eat or sleep separately; also, and especially, each member of the band is paired off with one, two, or three other members, so if he has a disagree ment with the leader, he will not leave alone but will take along his allies, whose combined departure will threaten to break up the entire gang; finally, there is a diffuse age limit, and at about age fifteen a member is inevitably induced to quit the gang. *1*3 These mechanisms cannot be under stood without renouncing the evolutionist vision that sees bands or packs as a rudimentary, less organized, social form. Even in bands of animals, leadership is a complex mechanism that does not act to promote the strongest but rather inhibits the installation of stable powers, in favor of a fabric of immanent relations. 14 One could just as easily compare the form "high-society life" to the form "sociability" among the most highly evolved men and women: high-society groups are similar to gangs and operate by the diffusion of prestige rather than by reference to centers of power, as in social groupings (Proust clearly showed this noncorrespondence of high-society values and social values). Eugene Sue, a man of high society and a dandy, whom legitimists reproached for frequenting the Orleans family, used to say: "I'm not on the side of the family, I side with the pack." Packs, bands, are groups of the rhizome type, as opposed to the arborescent type that centers around organs of power. That is why bands in general, even those engaged in banditry or high-society life, are metamorphoses of a war machine formally distinct from all State apparatuses or their equivalents, which are instead what structure centralized societies. We certainly would not say that discipline is what defines a war machine: discipline is the characteristic required of armies after the State has appropriated them. The war machine answers to other rules. We are not saying that they are better, of course, only that they animate a fundamental indiscipline of the warrior, a questioning of hierarchy, perpetual blackmail by abandonment or betrayal, and a very volatile sense of honor, all of which, once again, impedes the formation of the State. But why does this argument fail to convince us entirely? We follow Clastres when he demonstrates that the State is explained neither by a development of productive forces nor by a differentiation of political

It is the State, on the contrary, that makes possible the undertaking of large-scale projects, the constitution of surpluses, and the organization of the corresponding public functions. The State is what makes the distinc tion between governors and governed possible. We do not see how the State can be explained by what it presupposes, even with recourse to dialectics. The State seems to rise up in a single stroke, in an imperial form, and does not depend on progressive factors. Its on-the-spot emergence is like a stroke of genius, the birth of Athena. We also follow Clastres when he shows that the war machine is directed against the State, either against potential States whose formation it wards off in advance, or against actual States whose destruction it purposes. No doubt the war machine is realized more completely in the "barbaric" assemblages of nomadic warriors than in the "savage" assemblages of primitive societies. In any case, it is out of the question that the State could be the result of a war in which the conquerors imposed, by the very fact of their victory, a new law on the vanquished, because the organization of the war machine is directed against the State-form, actual or virtual. The State is no better accounted for as a result of war than by a progression of economic or political forces. This is where Clastres locates the break: between "primitive" counter-State societies and "monstrous" State societies whose formation it is no longer possible to explain. Clastres is fascinated by the problem of "voluntary servitude," in the manner of La Boetie: In what way did people want or desire servitude, which most certainly did not come to them as the outcome of an involuntary and unfortunate war? They did, after all, have counter-State mechanisms at their disposal: So how and why the State? Why did the State triumph? The more deeply Clastres delved into the problem, the more he seemed to deprive himself of the means of resolving it.' 5 He tended to make primitive societies hypostases, self-sufficient entities (he insisted heavily on this point). He made their formal exteriority into a real independence. Thus he remained an evolutionist, and posited a state of nature. Only this state of nature was, according to him, a fully social reality instead of a pure concept, and the evolution was a sudden mutation instead of a development. For on the one hand, the State rises up in a single stroke, fully formed; on the other, the counter-State societies use very specific mechanisms to ward it off, to prevent it from arising. We believe that these two propositions are valid but that their interlinkage is flawed. There is an old scenario: "from clans to empires," or "from bands to kingdoms." But nothing says that this constitutes an evolution, since bands and clans are no less organized than empire-kingdoms. We will never leave the evolution hypothesis behind by creating a break between the two terms, that is, by endowing bands with self-sufficiency and the State with an emergence all the more miraculous and monstrous.

0 360 □ 1227: TREATISE ON NOMADOLOGY—THE WAR MACHINE We are compelled to say that there has always been a State, quite perfect, quite complete. The more discoveries archaeologists make, the more empires they uncover. The hypothesis of the *Urstaat *seems to be verified: "The State clearly dates back to the most remote ages of humanity." It is hard to imagine primitive societies that would not have been in contact with imperial States, at the periphery or in poorly controlled areas. But of greater importance is the inverse hypothesis: that the State itself has always been in a relation with an outside and is inconceivable independent of that relationship. The law of the State is not the law of All or Nothing (State societies *or *counter-State societies) but that of interior and exterior. The State is sovereignty. But sovereignty only reigns over what it is capable of internalizing, of appropriating locally. Not only is there no universal State, but the outside of States cannot be reduced to "foreign policy," that is, to a set of relations among States. The outside appears simultaneously in two directions: huge worldwide machines branched out over the entire  *ecumenon *at a given moment, which enjoy a large measure of autonomy in relation to the States (for example, commercial organization of the "multi national" type, or industrial complexes, or even religious formations like Christianity, Islam, certain prophetic or messianic movements, etc.); but also the local mechanisms of bands, margins, minorities, which continue to affirm the rights of segmentary societies in opposition to the organs of State power. The modern world can provide us today with particularly well developed images of these two directions: worldwide ecumenical machines, but also a neoprimitivism, a new tribal society as described by Marshall McLuhan. These directions are equally present in all social fields, in all periods. It even happens that they partially merge. For exam ple, a commercial organization is also a band of pillage, or piracy, for part of its course and in many of its activities; or it is in bands that a religious formation begins to operate. What becomes clear is that bands, no less than worldwide organizations, imply a form irreducible to the State and that this form of exteriority necessarily presents itself as a diffuse and polymorphous war machine. It is a *nomos *very different from the "law." The State-form, as a form of interiority, has a tendency to reproduce itself, remaining identical to itself across its variations and easily recognizable within the limits of its poles, always seeking public recognition (there is no masked State). But the war machine's form of exteriority is such that it exists only in its own metamorphoses; it exists in an industrial innovation as well as in a technological invention, in a commercial circuit as well as in a religious creation, in all flows and currents that only secondarily allow themselves to be appropriated by the State. It is in terms not of indepen dence, but of coexistence and competition *in a perpetual field of interac-  tion, *that we must conceive of exteriority and interiority, war machines of

The same field circumscribes its interiority in States, but describes its exteriority in what escapes States or stands against States. P ROPOSITION III. *The exteriority of the war ma chine is also attested to by * *epistemology, which intimates the existence and perpetuation of a  "nomad"or "minor science."* There is a kind of science, or treatment of science, that seems very dif ficult to classify, whose history is even difficult to follow. What we are referring to are not "technologies" in the usual sense of the term. But nei ther are they "sciences" in the royal or legal sense established by history. According to a recent book by Michel Serres, both the atomic physics of Democritus and Lucretius and the geometry of Archimedes are marked by it. 16 The characteristics of this kind of eccentric science would seem to be the following: 1. First of all, it uses a hydraulic model, rather than being a theory of solids treating fluids as a special case; ancient atomism is inseparable from flows, and flux is reality itself, or consistency. 2. The model in question is one of becoming and heterogeneity, as opposed to the stable, the eternal, the identical, the constant. It is a "para dox" to make becoming itself a model, and no longer a secondary charac teristic, a copy; in the *Timaeus, *Plato raises this possibility, but only in order to exclude it and conjure it away in the name of royal science. By con trast, in atomism, just such a model of heterogeneity, and of passage or becoming in the heterogeneous, is furnished by the famed declination of the atom. The *clinamen, *as the minimum angle, has meaning only between a straight line and a curve, the curve and its tangent, and constitutes the original curvature of the movement of the atom. The clinamen is the small est angle by which an atom deviates from a straight path. 17 It is a passage to the limit, an exhaustion, a paradoxical "exhaustive" model. The same applies to Archimedean geometry, in which the straight line, defined as "the shortest path between two points," is just a way of defining the length of a curve in a predifferential calculus. 3. One no longer goes from the straight line to its parallels, in a lamellar or laminar flow, 18 but from a curvilinear declination to the formation of spirals and vortices on an inclined plane: the greatest slope for the smallest angle. From *turba *to *turbo: *in other words, from bands or packs of atoms to the great vortical organizations. 19 The model is a vortical one; it operates in an open space throughout which things-flows are distributed, rather than plotting out a closed space for linear and solid things. It is the difference between a *smooth *(vectorial, projective, or topological) space and a *striated*

Finally, the model is problematic, rather than theorematic: figures are considered only from the viewpoint of the *affections *that befall them: sections, ablations, adjunctions, projections. One does not go by specific differences from a genus to its species, or by deduction from a stable essence to the properties deriving from it, but rather from a problem to the accidents that condition and resolve it. This involves all kinds of deformations, transmutations, passages to the limit, operations in which each figure designates an "event" much more than an essence; the square no longer exists independently of a quadrature, the cube of a cubature, the straight line of a rectification. Whereas the theorem belongs to the rational order, the problem is affective and is inseparable from the meta morphoses, generations, and creations within science itself. Despite what Gabriel Marcel may say, the problem is not an "obstacle"; it is the surpass ing of the obstacle, a pro-jection, in other words, a war machine. All of this movement is what royal science is striving to limit when it reduces as much as possible the range of the "problem-element" and subordinates it to the "theorem-element." 21 This Archimedean science, or this conception of science, is bound up in an essential way with the war machine: the*problemata *are the war machine itself and are inseparable from inclined planes, passages to the limit, vorti ces, and projections. It would seem that the war machine is projected into an abstract knowledge formally different from the one that doubles the State apparatus. It would seem that a whole nomad science develops eccentrically, one that is very different from the royal or imperial sciences. Furthermore, this nomad science is continually "barred," inhibited, or banned by the demands and conditions of State science. Archimedes, van quished by the Roman State, becomes a symbol. 22 The fact is that the two kinds of science have different modes of formalization, and State science continually imposes its form of sovereignty on the inventions of nomad science. State science retains of nomad science only what it can appropri ate; it turns the rest into a set of strictly limited formulas without any real scientific status, or else simply represses and bans it. It is as if the "savants" of nomad science were caught between a rock and a hard place, between the war machine that nourishes and inspires them and the State that imposes upon them an order of reasons. The figure of the *engineer *(in particular the military engineer), with all its ambivalence, is illustrative of this situation. Most significant are perhaps borderline phenomena in which nomad sci ence exerts pressure on State science, and, conversely, State science appro priates and transforms the elements of nomad science. This is true of the art of encampments, "castrametation," which has always mobilized pro

It is true of descriptive and projective geometry, which royal science would like to turn into a mere practical dependency of analytic, or so-called higher, geometry (thus the ambiguous situation of Monge and Poncelet as "savants"). 23 It is also true of differential calculus. For a long time, it had only parascientific status and was labeled a "Gothic hypothesis"; royal science only accorded it the value of a convenient convention or a well-founded fiction. The great State mathematicians did their best to improve its status, but precisely on the condition that all the dynamic, nomadic notions—such as becoming, heterogeneity, infinitesimal, passage to the limit, continuous variation —be eliminated and civil, static, and ordinal rules be imposed upon it (Carnot's ambiguous position in this respect). Finally, it is true of the hydraulic model, for it is certain that the State itself needs a hydraulic sci ence (there is no going back on Wittfogel's theses on the importance of large-scale waterworks for an empire). But it needs it in a very different form, because the State needs to subordinate hydraulic force to conduits, pipes, embankments, which prevent turbulence, which constrain move ment to go from one point to another, and space itself to be striated and measured, which makes the fluid depend on the solid, and flows proceed by parallel, laminar layers. The hydraulic model of nomad science and the war machine, on the other hand, consists in being distributed by turbu lence across a smooth space, in producing a movement that holds space and simultaneously affects all of its points, instead of being held by space in a local movement from one specified point to another. 24 Democritus, Menaechmus, Archimedes, Vauban, Desargues, Bernoulli, Monge, Carnot, Poncelet, Perronet, etc.: in each case a monograph would be neces sary to take into account the special situation of these savants whom State science used only after restraining or disciplining them, after repressing their social or political conceptions. The sea as a smooth space is a specific problem of the war machine. As Virilio shows, it is at sea that the problem of the *fleet in being *is posed, in other words, the task of occupying an open space with a vortical movement that can rise up at any point. In this respect, the recent studies on rhythm, on the origin of that notion, do not seem entirely convincing. For we are told that rhythm has nothing to do with the movement of waves but rather that it designates "form" in general, and more specifically the form of a "measured, cadenced" movement. 25 However, rhythm is never the same as measure. And though the atomist Democritus is one of the authors who

0 364 D 1227: TREATISE ON NOMADOLOGY—THE WAR MACHINE speak of rhythm in the sense of form, it should be borne in mind that he does so under very precise conditions of fluctuation and that the forms made by atoms are primarily large, nonmetric aggregates, smooth spaces such as the air, the sea, or even the earth *(magnae res). *There is indeed such a thing as measured, cadenced rhythm, relating to the coursing of a river between its banks or to the form of a striated space; but there is also a rhythm without measure, which relates to the upswell of a flow, in other words, to the manner in which a fluid occupies a smooth space. This opposition, or rather this tension-limit between the two kinds of science—nomad, war machine science and royal, State science—reap pears at different moments, on different levels. The work of Anne Querrien enables us to identify two of these moments; one is the construction of Gothic cathedrals in the twelfth century, the other the construction of bridges in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. 26 Gothic architecture is indeed inseparable from a will to build churches longer and taller than the Romanesque churches. Ever farther, ever higher ... But this difference is not simply quantitative; it marks a qualitative change: the static relation, form-matter, tends to fade into the background in favor of a dynamic rela tion, material-forces. It is the cutting of the stone that turns it into material capable of holding and coordinating forces of thrust, and of constructing ever higher and longer vaults. The vault is no longer a form but the line of continuous variation of the stones. It is as if Gothic conquered a smooth space, while Romanesque remained partially within a striated space (in which the vault depends on the juxtaposition of parallel pillars). But stone cutting is inseparable from, on the one hand, a plane of projection at ground level, which functions as a plane limit, and, on the other hand, a series of successive approximations (squaring), or placings-in-variation of voluminous stones. Of course, one appealed to the theorematic science of Euclid in order to find a foundation for the enterprise: mathematical fig ures and equations were thought to be the intelligible form capable of orga nizing surfaces and volumes. But according to the legend, Bernard de Clairvaux quickly abandoned the effort as too "difficult," appealing to the specificity of an operative, Archimedean geometry, a projective and descriptive geometry defined as a minor science, more a mathegraphy than a matheology. His journeyman, the monk-mason Garin de Troyes, speaks of an operative logic of movement enabling the "initiate" to draw, then hew the volumes "in penetration in space," to make it so that "the cutting line propels the equation" *(le trait pousse le chiffre).* *21* * *One does not represent, one engenders and traverses. This science is characterized less by the absence of equations than by the very different role they play: instead of being good forms absolutely that organize matter, they are "generated" as "forces of thrust" *(poussees) *by the material, in a qualitative calculus of the

This whole current of Archimedean geometry was taken to its highest expression, but was also brought to a temporary standstill, by the remarkable seventeenth-century mathematician Desargues. Like most of his kind, Desargues wrote little; he nevertheless exerted a great influence through his actions and left outlines, rough drafts, and projects, all cen tered on problem-events: "Lamentations," "draft project for the cutting of stones," "draft project for grappling with the events of the encounters of a cone and a plane,. .. Desargues, however, was condemned by the  *parlement *of Paris, opposed by the king's secretary; his practices of per spective were banned. 28 Royal, or State, science only tolerates and appro priates stone cutting by means of *templates *(the opposite of squaring), under conditions that restore the primacy of the fixed model of form, mathematical figures, and measurement. Royal science only tolerates and appropriates perspective if it is static, subjected to a central black hole divesting it of its heuristic and ambulatory capacities. But the adventure, or event, of Desargues is the same one that had already occurred among the Gothic "journeymen" on a collective level. For not only did the Church, in its imperial form, feel the need to strictly control the movement of this nomad science (it entrusted the Templars with the responsibility of deter mining its locations and objects, governing the work sites, and regulating construction), but the secular State, in its royal form, turned against the Templars themselves, banning the guilds for a number of reasons, at least one of which was the prohibition of this operative or minor geometry. Is Anne Querrien right to find yet another echo of the same story in the case of bridges in the eighteenth century? Doubtless, the conditions were very different, for the division of labor according to State norms was by then an accomplished fact. But the fact remains that in the government agency in charge of bridges and roadways, roadways were under a well-centralized administration while bridges were still the object of active, dynamic, and collective experimentation. Trudaine organized unusual, open "general assemblies" in his home. Perronet took as his inspiration a supple model originating in the Orient: The bridge should not choke or obstruct the river. To the heaviness of the bridge, to the striated space of thick and regular piles, he opposed a thinning and discontinuity of the piles, surbase, and vault, a lightness and continuous variation of the whole. But his attempt soon ran up against principled opposition; the State, in naming Perronet director of the school, followed a frequently used procedure that inhibited experimentation more than crowning its achievements. The whole history of the Ecole des Ponts et Chaussees (School of Bridges and Roadways) illustrates how this old, plebeian "corps" was subordinated to the Ecole des Mines, the Ecole des Travaux Publics, and the Ecole Polytechnique, at the same time as its activities were increasingly

They have a special relation to families, because they link the family model to the State model at both ends and regard themselves as "great families" of functionaries, clerks, intendants, or farmers. Yet it seems that in many of these collective bodies there is something else at work that does not fit into this schema. It is not just their obstinate defense of their privileges. It is also their aptitude—even caricatural or seriously deformed—to constitute themselves as a war machine, following other models, another dynamism, a nomadic ambition, over against the State. As an example, there is the very old problem of the *lobby, *a group with fluid contours, whose position is very ambiguous in relation to the State it wishes to "influence" and the war machine it wishes to promote, to whatever ends. 30 A *body {corps) *is not reducible to an *organism, *any more than esprit de corps is reducible to the soul of an organism. Spirit is not better, but it is volatile, whereas the soul is weighted, a center of gravity. Must we invoke a military origin of the collective body and esprit de corps? "Military" is not the part that counts, but rather the distant nomadic origin. Ibn Khaldun defines the nomad war machine by: families or lineages PLUS esprit de corps. The war machine entertains a relation to families that is very differ ent from its relation to the State. In the war machine, the family is a band vector instead of a fundamental cell; a genealogy is transferred from one family to another according to the aptitude of a given family at a given time to realize the maximum of "agnatic solidarity." Here, it is not the public eminence of a family that determines its place in a State organism but the reverse; it is the secret power *(puissance), *or strength of solidarity, and the corresponding genealogical mobility that determine its eminence in a war body. 31 This has to do neither with the monopoly of an organic power *(pouvoir) *nor with local representation, but is related to the potential *(puis-  sance) *of a vortical body in a nomad space. Of course, the great bodies of a modern State can hardly be thought of as Arab tribes. What we wish to say, rather, is that collective bodies always have fringes or minorities that recon stitute equivalents of the war machine—in sometimes quite unforeseen forms—in specific assemblages such as building bridges or cathedrals or rendering judgments or making music or instituting a science, a technology ... A collective body of captains asserts its demands through the organiza tion of the officers and the organism of the superior officers. There are always periods when the State as organism has problems with its own col lective bodies, when these bodies, claiming certain privileges, are forced in spite of themselves to open onto something that exceeds them, a short revo

A confused situation: each time it occurs, it is necessary to analyze tendencies and poles, the nature of the movements. All of a sudden, it is as if the collective body of the notary pub lics were advancing like Arabs or Indians, then regrouping and reorganiz ing: a comic opera where you never know what is going to happen next (even the cry "The police are with us!" is sometimes heard). Husserl speaks of a protogeometry that addresses *vague, *in other words, vagabond or nomadic, morphological essences. These essences are distinct from sensible things, as well as from ideal, royal, or imperial essences. Protogeometry, the science dealing with them, is itself vague, in the etymo logical sense of "vagabond": it is neither inexact like sensible things nor exact like ideal essences, but *anexactyet rigorous *("essentially and not acci dentally inexact"). The circle is an organic, ideal, fixed essence, but round ness is a vague and fluent essence, distinct both from the circle and things that are round (a vase, a wheel, the sun). A theorematic figure is a fixed essence, but its transformations, distortions, ablations, and augmentations, all of its variations, form problematic figures that are vague yet rigorous, "lens-shaped," "umbelliform," or "indented." It could be said that vague essences extract from things a determination that is more than thinghood  *(choseite), *which is that *of corporeality (corporeite), *and which perhaps even implies an esprit de corps. 32 But why does Husserl see this as a protogeometry, a kind of halfway point and not a pure science? Why does he make pure essences dependent upon a passage to the limit, when any passage to the limit belongs as such to the vague? What we have, rather, are two formally different conceptions of science, and, ontologically, a single field of interaction in which royal science continually appropriates the contents of vague or nomad science while nomad science continually cuts the contents of royal science loose. At the limit, all that counts is the con stantly shifting borderline. In Husserl (and also in Kant, though in the opposite direction: roundness as the "schema" of the circle), we find a very accurate appreciation of the irreducibility of nomad science, but simulta neously the concern of a man of the State, or one who sides with the State, to maintain a legislative and constituent primacy for royal science. When ever this primacy is taken for granted, nomad science is portrayed as a prescientific or parascientific or subscientific agency. And most impor tant, it becomes impossible to understand the relations between science and technology, science and practice, because nomad science is not a sim ple technology or practice, but a scientific field in which the problem of these relations is brought out and resolved in an entirely different way than from the point of view of royal science. The State is perpetually producing and reproducing ideal circles, but a war machine is necessary to make something round. Thus the specific characteristics of nomad science are

Nomad science does not have the same relation to work as royal science. Not that the division of labor in nomad science is any less thorough; it is different. We know of the problems States have always had with journey men's associations, or *compagnonnages, *the nomadic or itinerant bodies of the type formed by masons, carpenters, smiths, etc. Settling, seden-tarizing labor power, regulating the movement of the flow of labor, assigning it channels and conduits, forming corporations in the sense of organisms, and, for the rest, relying on forced manpower recruited on the spot (corvee) or among indigents (charity workshops)—this has always been one of the principal affairs of the State, which undertook to conquer both a *band vagabondage *and a *body nomadism. *Let us return to the exam ple of Gothic architecture for a reminder of how extensively the journey men traveled, building cathedrals near and far, scattering construction sites across the land, drawing on an active and passive power (mobility and the strike) that was far from convenient for the State. The State's response was to take over management of the construction sites, merging all the divi sions of labor in the supreme distinction between the intellectual and the manual, the theoretical and the practical, modeled upon the difference between "governors" and "governed." In the nomad sciences, as in the royal sciences, we find the existence of a "plane," but not at all in the same way. The ground-level plane of the Gothic journeyman is opposed to the metric plane of the architect, which is on paper and off site. The plane of consistency or composition is opposed to another plane, that of organiza tion or formation. Stone cutting by squaring is opposed to stone cutting using templates, which implies the erection of a model for reproduction. It can be said not only that there is no longer a need for skilled or qualified labor, but also that there is a need for unskilled or unqualified labor, for a dequalification of labor. The State does not give power *(pouvoir) *to the intellectuals or conceptual innovators; on the contrary, it makes them a strictly dependent organ with an autonomy that is only imagined yet is suf ficient to divest those whose job it becomes simply to reproduce or imple ment of all of their power *(puissance). *This does not shield the State from more trouble, this time with the body of intellectuals it itself engendered, but which asserts new nomadic and political claims. In any case, if the State always finds it necessary to repress the nomad and minor sciences, if it opposes vague essences and the operative geometry of the trait, it does so not because the content of these sciences is inexact or imperfect, or because of their magic or initiatory character, but because they imply a division of labor opposed to the norms of the State. The difference is not extrinsic: the way in which a science, or a conception of science, participates in the

Royal science is inseparable from a "hylomorphic" model implying both a form that organizes matter and a matter prepared for the form; it has often been shown that this schema derives less from technology or life than from a society divided into gover nors and governed, and later, intellectuals and manual laborers. What characterizes it is that all matter is assigned to content, while all form passes into expression. It seems that nomad science is more immediately in tune with the connection between content and expression in themselves, each of these two terms encompassing both form and matter. Thus matter, in nomad science, is never prepared and therefore homogenized matter, but is essentially laden with singularities (which constitute a form of con tent). And neither is expression formal; it is inseparable from pertinent traits (which constitute a matter of expression). This is an entirely different schema, as we shall see. We can get a preliminary idea of this situation by recalling the most general characteristic of nomad art, in which a dynamic connection between support and ornament replaces the matter-form dia lectic. From the point of view of nomad science, which presents itself as an art as much as a technique, the division of labor fully exists, but it does not employ the form-matter duality (even in the case of biunivocal corre spondences). Rather, it *follows *the connections between singularities of matter and traits of expression, and lodges on the level of these connec tions, whether they be natural or forced. 33 This is another organization of work and of the social field through work. It is instructive to contrast two models of science, after the manner of Plato in the *Timaeus.* *34* * *One could be called *Compars *and the other *Dispars. *The compars is the legal or legalist model employed by royal sci ence. The search for laws consists in extracting constants, even if those con stants are only relations between variables (equations). An invariable form for variables, a variable matter of the invariant: such is the foundation of the hylomorphic schema. But for the dispars as an element of nomad sci ence the relevant distinction is material-forces rather than matter-form. Here, it is not exactly a question of extracting constants from variables but of placing the variables themselves in a state of continuous variation. If there are still equations, they are adequations, inequations, differential equations irreducible to the algebraic form and inseparable from a sensible intuition of variation. They seize or determine singularities in the matter, instead of constituting a general form. They effect individuations through events or haecceities, not through the "object" as a compound of matter and form; vague essences are nothing other than haecceities. In all these respects, there is an opposition between the *logos *and the *nomos, *the law and the *nomos, *prompting the comment that the law still "savors of

That it does is evident in the homogeneous space corresponding to the compars. Homogeneous space is in no way a smooth space; on the contrary, it is the form of striated space. The space of  *pillars. *It is striated by the fall of bodies, the verticals of gravity, the distri bution of matter into parallel layers, the lamellar and laminar movement of flows. These parallel verticals have formed an independent dimension capable of spreading everywhere, of formalizing all the other dimensions, of striating all of space in all of its directions, so as to render it homoge neous. The vertical distance between two points provided the mode of comparison for the horizontal distance between two other points. Univer sal attraction became the law of all laws, in that it set the rule for the biunivocal correspondence between two bodies; and each time science dis covered a new field, it sought to formalize it in the same mode as the field of gravity. Even chemistry became a royal science only by virtue of a whole theoretical elaboration of the notion of weight. Euclidean space is founded on the famous parallel postulate, but the parallels in question are in the first place gravitational parallels, and correspond to the forces exerted by gravity on all the elements of a body presumed to fill that space. It is the point of application of the resultant of all of these parallel forces that remains invariable when their common direction is changed or the body is rotated (the *center of gravity). *In short, it seems that the force of gravity lies at the basis of a laminar, striated, homogeneous, and centered space; it forms the foundation for those multiplicities termed metric, or arborescent, whose dimensions are independent of the situation and are expressed with the aid of units and points (movements from one point to another). It was not some metaphysical concern, but an effectively scien tific one, that frequently led scientists in the nineteenth century to ask if all forces were not reducible to gravity, or rather to the form of attraction that gives gravity a universal value (a constant relation for all variables) and biunivocal scope (two bodies at a time, and no more). It is the form of interiority of all science. The *nomos, *or the dispars, is altogether different. But this is not to say that the other forces refute gravity or contradict attraction. Although it is true that they do not go against them, they do not result from them either; they do not depend on them but testify to events that are always supple mentary or of "variable affects." Each time a new *field *opened up in science—under conditions making this a far more important notion than that of form or object—it proved irreducible to the field of attraction and the model of the gravitational forces, although not contradictory to them. It affirmed a "more" or an excess, and lodged itself in that excess, that devi ation. When chemistry took a decisive step forward, it was always by add

Smooth space is precisely the space of the smallest deviation: therefore it has no homogene ity, except between infinitely proximate points, and the linking of proximi ties is effected independently of any determined path. It is a space of contact, of small tactile or manual actions of contact, rather than a visual space like Euclid's striated space. Smooth space is a field without conduits or channels. A field, a heterogeneous smooth space, is wedded to a very particular type of multiplicity: nonmetric, acentered, rhizomatic multipli cities that occupy space without "counting" it and can "be explored only by legwork." They do not meet the visual condition of being observable from a point in space external to them; an example of this is the system of sounds, or even of colors, as opposed to Euclidean space. When we oppose speed and slowness, the quick and the weighty, *Celeritas and Gravitas, *this must not be seen as a quantitative opposition, or as a mythological structure (although Dumezil has established the myth ological importance of this opposition, precisely in relation to the State apparatus and its natural "gravity"). The opposition is both qualitative and scientific, in that speed is not merely an abstract characteristic of movement in general but is incarnated in a moving body that deviates, however slightly, from its line of descent or gravity. *Slow and rapid are not  quantitative degrees of movement but rather two types of qualified move-  ment, *whatever the speed of the former or the tardiness of the latter. Strictly speaking, it cannot be said that a body that is dropped has a speed, however fast it falls; rather it has an infinitely decreasing slowness in accor dance with the law of falling bodies. Laminar movement that striates space, that goes from one point to another, is weighty; but rapidity, celerity, applies only to movement that deviates to the minimum extent and there after assumes a vortical motion, occupying a smooth space, actually draw ing smooth space itself. In this space, matter-flow can no longer be cut into parallel layers, and movement no longer allows itself to be hemmed into biunivocal relations between points. In this sense, the role of the qualita tive opposition gravity-celerity, heavy-light, slow-rapid is not that of a quantifiable scientific determination but of a condition that is coextensive to science and that regulates both the separation and the mixing of the two models, their possible interpenetration, the domination of one by the other, their alternative. And the best formulation, that of Michel Serres, is indeed couched in terms of an alternative, whatever mixes or composi

The first involves reproduction, iteration and reiteration; the other, involving itineration, is the sum of the itinerant, ambulant sciences. Itineration is too readily reduced to a modality of technology, or of the application and veri fication of science. But this is not the case: *following is not at all the same  thing as reproducing, *and one never follows in order to reproduce. The ideal of reproduction, deduction, or induction is part of royal science, at all times and in all places, and treats differences of time and place as so many variables, the constant form of which is extracted precisely by the law: for the same phenomena to recur in a gravitational and striated space it is suf ficient for the same conditions to obtain, or for the same constant relation to hold between the differing conditions and the variable phenomena. Reproducing implies the permanence of a fixed point of *view *that is exter nal to what is reproduced: watching the flow from the bank. But following is something different from the ideal of reproduction. Not better, just dif ferent. One is obliged to follow when one is in search of the "singularities" of a matter, or rather of a material, and not out to discover a form; when one escapes the force of gravity to enter a field of celerity; when one ceases to contemplate the course of a laminar flow in a determinate direction, to be carried away by a vortical flow; when one engages in a continuous varia tion of variables, instead of extracting constants from them, etc. And the meaning of Earth completely changes: with the legal model, one is con stantly reterritorializing around a point of view, on a domain, according to a set of constant relations; but with the ambulant model, the process of deterritorialization constitutes and extends the territory itself. "Go first to your old plant and watch carefully the watercourse made by the rain. By now the rain must have carried the seeds far away. Watch the crevices made by the runoff, and from them determine the direction of the flow. Then find the plant that is growing at the farthest point from your plant. All the devil's weed plants that are growing in between are yours. Later. . . you can extend the size of your territory." 38 *There are itinerant, ambulant sciences * *that consist in following a flow in a vectorial field across which singularities  are scattered like so many "accidents" *(problems). For example, why is primitive metallurgy necessarily an ambulant science that confers upon smiths a quasi-nomadic status? It could be objected that in these examples it is still a question of going from one point to another (even if they are sin gular points) through the intermediary of channels, and that it is still possi ble to cut the flow into layers. But this is only true to the extent that ambulant procedures and processes are necessarily tied to a striated

As a general rule, a smooth space, a vectorial field, a nonmetric multiplicity are always translatable, and necessarily translated, into a "compars": a fundamental operation by which one repeatedly overlays upon each point of smooth space a tangent Euclidean space endowed with a sufficient number of dimensions, by which one reintroduces parallelism between two vectors, treating multipli city as though it were immersed in this homogeneous and striated space of reproduction, instead of continuing to follow it in an "exploration by leg-work." 39 This is the triumph of the *logos *or the law over the *nomos. *But the complexity of the operation testifies to the existence of resistances it must overcome. Whenever ambulant procedure and process are returned to their own model, the points regain their position as singularities that exclude all biunivocal relations, the flow regains its curvilinear and vortical motion that excludes any parallelism between vectors, and smooth space reconquers the properties of contact that prevent it from remaining homogeneous and striated. There is always a current preventing the ambu lant or itinerant sciences from being completely internalized in the repro ductive royal sciences. There is a type of ambulant scientist whom State scientists are forever fighting or integrating or allying with, even going so far as to propose a minor position for them within the legal system of sci ence and technology. It is not that the ambulant sciences are more saturated with irrational procedures, with mystery and magic. They only get that way when they fall into abeyance. And the royal sciences, for their part, also surround them selves with much priestliness and magic. Rather, what becomes apparent in the rivalry between the two models is that the ambulant or nomad sci ences do not destine science to take on an autonomous power, or even to have an autonomous development. They do not have the means for that because they subordinate all their operations to the sensible conditions of intuition and construction—*following *the flow of matter, *drawing and  linking up *smooth space. Everything is situated in an objective zone of fluctuation that is coextensive with reality itself. However refined or rigor ous, "approximate knowledge" is still dependent upon sensitive and sensi ble evaluations that pose more problems than they solve: problematics is still its only mode. In contrast, what is proper to royal science, to its theorematic or axiomatic power, is to isolate all operations from the condi tions of intuition, making them true intrinsic concepts, or "categories." That is precisely why deterritorialization, in this kind of science, implies a reterritorialization in the conceptual apparatus. Without this categorical, apodictic apparatus, the differential operations would be constrained to

Certain of these requirements are translated in terms of "safety": the two cathedrals at Orleans and Beauvais collapsed at the end of the twelfth century, and control calculations are difficult to effect for the con structions of ambulant science. Although safety is a fundamental element in the theoretical norms of the State, and of the political ideal, there is also something else at issue as well. Due to all their procedures, the ambulant sciences quickly overstep the possibility of calculation: they inhabit that "more" that exceeds the space of reproduction and soon run into problems that are insurmountable from that point of view; they eventually resolve those problems by means of a real-life operation. The solutions are sup posed to come from a set of activities that constitute them as nonautono-mous. Only royal science, in contrast, has at its disposal a metric power that can define a conceptual apparatus or an autonomy of science (including the autonomy of experimental science). That is why it is necessary to couple ambulant spaces with a space of homogeneity, without which the laws of physics would depend on particular points in space. But this is less a translation than a constitution: precisely that constitution the ambulant sciences did not undertake, and do not have the means to undertake. In the field of interaction of the two sciences, the ambulant sciences confine themselves to *inventing problems *whose solution is tied to a whole set of collective, nonscientific activities but whose *scientific  solution *depends, on the contrary, on royal science and the way it has transformed the problem by introducing it into its theorematic apparatus and its organization of work. This is somewhat like intuition and intelligence in Bergson, where only intelligence has the scientific means to solve formally the problems posed by intuition, problems that intuition would be content to entrust to the qualitative activities of a humanity engaged in *following *matter. 40 P ROBLEM II. *Is there a way to extricate thought from the State model? * P ROPOSITION IV. *The exteriority of the war machine is attested to, * *finally, by noology.* Thought contents are sometimes criticized for being too conformist.

And if these two heads are in interference, it is not only because there are many intermediaries and transitions between them, and because the first prepares the way for the second and the second uses and retains the first, but also because, antithetical and complementary, they are necessary to one another. It is not out of the question, however, that in order to pass from one to the other there must occur, "between" them, an event of an entirely different nature, one that hides outside the image, takes place out side. 41 But confining ourselves to the image, it appears that it is not simply a metaphor when we are told of an *imperium *of truth and a republic of spirits. It is the necessary condition for the constitution of thought as principle, or as a form of interiority, as a stratum. It is easy to see what thought gains from this: a gravity it would never have on its own, a center that makes everything, including the State, appear to exist by its own efficacy or on its own sanction. But the State gains just as much. Indeed, by developing in thought in this way the State-form gains something essential: a whole consensus. Only thought is capable of invent ing the fiction of a State that is universal by right, of elevating the State to the level of de jure universality. It is as if the sovereign were left alone in the world, spanned the entire ecumenon, and now dealt only with actual or potential subjects. It is no longer a question of powerful, extrinsic organiza tions, or of strange bands: the State becomes the sole principle separating rebel subjects, who are consigned to the state of nature, from consenting subjects, who rally to its form of their own accord. If it is advantageous for thought to prop itself up with the State, it is no less advantageous for the State to extend itself in thought, and to be sanctioned by it as the unique, universal form. The particularity of States becomes merely an accident of fact, as is their possible perversity, or their imperfection. For the modern State defines itself in principle as "the rational and reasonable organiza tion of a community": the only remaining particularity a community has is interior or moral *(the spirit of a people), *at the same time as the community is funneled by its organization toward the harmony of a universal *(absolute  spirit). *The State gives thought a form of interiority, and thought gives that interiority a form of universality: "The goal of worldwide organization is the satisfaction of reasonable individuals within particular free States." The exchange that takes place between the State and reason is a curious one; but that exchange is also an analytic proposition, because realized rea son is identified with the de jure State, just as the State is the becoming of

0 376 □ 1227: TREATISE ON NOMADOLOGY—THE WAR MACHINE reason. 42 In so-called modern philosophy, and in the so-called modern or rational State, everything revolves around the legislator and the subject. The State must realize the distinction between the legislator and the sub ject under formal conditions permitting thought, for its part, to conceptu alize their identity. Always obey. The more you obey, the more you will be master, for you will only be obeying pure reason, in other words yourself... Ever since philosophy assigned itself the role of ground it has been giving the established powers its blessing, and tracing its doctrine of faculties onto the organs of State power. Common sense, the unity of all the faculties at the center constituted by the Cogito, is the State consensus raised to the absolute. This was most notably the great operation of the Kantian "cri tique," renewed and developed by Hegelianism. Kant was constantly criti cizing bad usages, the better to consecrate the function. It is not at all surprising that the philosopher has become a public professor or State functionary. It was all over the moment the State-form inspired an image of thought. With full reciprocity. Doubtless, the image itself assumes differ ent contours in accordance with the variations on this form: it has not always delineated or designated the philosopher, and will not always delin eate him. It is possible to pass from a magical function to a rational func tion. The poet in the archaic imperial State was able to play the role of image trainer. 43 In modern States, the sociologist succeeded in replacing the philosopher (as, for example, when Durkheim and his disciples set out to give the republic a secular model of thought). Even today, psychoanaly sis lays claim to the role of *Cogitatio universalis *as the thought of the Law, in a magical return. And there are quite a few other competitors and pre tenders. Noology, which is distinct from ideology, is precisely the study of images of thought, and their historicity. In a sense, it could be said that all this has no importance, that thought has never had anything but laughable gravity. But that is all it requires: for us not to take it seriously. Because that makes it all the easier for it to think for us, and to be forever engendering new functionaries. Because the less people take thought seriously, the more they think in conformity with what the State wants. Truly, what man of the State has not dreamed of that paltry impossible thing—to be a thinker? But noology is confronted by counterthoughts, which are violent in their acts and discontinuous in their appearances, and whose existence is mobile in history. These are the acts of a "private thinker," as opposed to the public professor: Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, or even Shestov. Wherever they dwell, it is the steppe or the desert. They destroy images. Nietzsche's *Schopen-  hauer as Educator *is perhaps the greatest critique ever directed against the image of thought and its relation to the State. "Private thinker," however, is not a satisfactory expression, because it exaggerates interiority, when it is a question of *outside thought.* *44* * *To place thought in an immediate relation

1227: TREATISE ON NOMADOLOGY—THE WAR MACHINE □ 377 with the outside, with the forces of the outside, in short to make thought a war machine, is a strange undertaking whose precise procedures can be studied in Nietzsche (the aphorism, for example, is very different from the maxim, for a maxim, in the republic of letters, is like an organic State act or sovereign judgment, whereas an aphorism always awaits its meaning from a new external force, a final force that must conquer or subjugate it, utilize it). There is another reason why "private thinker" is not a good expression. Although it is true that this counterthought attests to an absolute solitude, it is an extremely populous solitude, like the desert itself, a solitude already intertwined with a people to come, one that invokes and awaits that people, existing only through it, though it is not yet here. "We are lacking that final force, in the absence of a people to bear us. We are looking for that popular support." Every thought is already a tribe, the opposite of a State. And this form of exteriority of thought is not at all symmetrical to the form of interiority. Strictly speaking, symmetry exists only between different poles or focal points of interiority. But the form of exteriority of thought—the force that is always external to itself, or the final force, the «th power—is not at all *another image *in opposition to the image inspired by the State apparatus. It is, rather, a force that destroys both the image *and *its copies, the model *and *its reproductions, every possibility of subordinating thought to a model of the True, the Just, or the Right (Cartesian truth, Kantian just, Hegelian right, etc.). A "method" is the striated space of the  *cogitatio universalis *and draws a path that must be followed from one point to another. But the form of exteriority situates thought in a smooth space that it must occupy without counting, and for which there is no possible method, no conceivable reproduction, but only relays, intermezzos, resur gences. Thought is like the Vampire; it has no image, either to constitute a model of or to copy. In the smooth space of Zen, the arrow does not go from one point to another but is taken up at any point, to be sent to any other point, and tends to permute with the archer and the target. The problem of the war machine is that of relaying, even with modest means, not that of the architectonic model or the monument. An ambulant people of relayers, rather than a model society. "Nature propels the philosopher into mankind like an arrow; it takes no aim but hopes the arrow will stick somewhere. But countless times it misses and is depressed at the fact.... The artist and the philosopher are evidence against the purposiveness of nature as regards the means it employs, though they are also first-rate evidence as to the wisdom of its purpose. They strike home at only a few, while they ought to strike home at everybody—and even these few are not struck with the force with which the philosopher and artist launch their shot." 45 We have in mind in particular two pathetic texts, in the sense that in them thought is truly a *pathos *(an *antilogos *and an *antimythos). *One is a

**□ II ►** 378 D 1227: TREATISE ON NOMADOLOGY—THE WAR MACHINE text by Artaud, in his letters to Jacques Riviere, explaining that thought operates on the basis of a *central breakdown, *that it lives solely by its own incapacity to take on form, bringing into relief only traits of expression in a material, developing peripherally, in a pure milieu of exteriority, as a func tion of singularities impossible to universalize, of circumstances impossi ble to interiorize. The other is the text by Kleist, "On the Gradual Formation of Ideas in Speech" ("Uber die allmachliche Verfertigung der Gedanken beim Reden"), in which Kleist denounces the central interiority of the concept as a means of control—the control of speech, of language, but also of affects, circumstances and even chance. He distinguishes this from thought as a proceeding and a process, a bizarre anti-Platonic dia logue, an antidialogue between brother and sister where one speaks before knowing while the other relays before having understood: this, Kleist says, is the thought of the *Gemut, *which proceeds like a general in a war machine should, or like a body charged with electricity, with pure intensity. "I mix inarticulate sounds, lengthen transitional terms, as well as using apposi tions when they are unnecessary." Gain some time, and then perhaps renounce, or wait. The necessity of not having control over language, of being a foreigner in one's own tongue, in order to draw speech to oneself and "bring something incomprehensible into the world." Such is the form of exteriority, the relation between brother and sister, the becoming-woman of the thinker, the becoming-thought of the woman: the  *Gemut *that refuses to be controlled, that forms a war machine. A thought grappling with exterior forces instead of being gathered up in an interior form, operating by relays instead of forming an image; an event-thought, a haecceity, instead of a subject-thought, a problem-thought instead of an essence-thought or theorem; a thought that appeals to a people instead of taking itself for a government ministry. Is it by chance that whenever a "thinker" shoots an arrow, there is a man of the State, a shadow or an image of a man of the State, that counsels and admonishes him, and wants to assign him a target or "aim"? Jacques Riviere does not hesitate to respond to Artaud: work at it, keep on working, things will come out all right, you will succeed in finding a method and in learning to express clearly what you think in essence *(cogitatio universalis). *Riviere is not a head of State, but he would not be the last in the *Nouvelle Revue Francaise *to mistake himself for the secret prince in a republic of letters or the gray eminence in a State of right. Lenz and Kleist confronted Goethe, that grandiose genius, of all men of letters a veritable man of the State. But that is not the worst of it: the worst is the way the texts of Kleist and Artaud themselves have ended up becoming monuments, inspiring a model to be copied—a model far more insidious than the others—for the artificial stammerings and innumerable tracings that claim to be their equal.

0 1227: TREATISE ON NOMADOLOGY—THE WAR MACHINE □ 379 The classical image of thought, and the striating of mental space it effects, aspires to universality. It in effect operates with two "universals," the Whole as the final ground of being or all-encompassing horizon, and the Subject as the principle that converts being into being-for-us. 46 *Im-perium *and republic. Between the two, all of the varieties of the real and the true find their place in a striated mental space, from the double point of view of Being and the Subject, under the direction of a "universal method." It is now easy for us to characterize the nomad thought that rejects this image and does things differently. It does not ally itself with a universal thinking subject but, on the contrary, with a singular race; and it does not ground itself in an all-encompassing totality but is on the contrary deployed in a horizonless milieu that is a smooth space, steppe, desert, or sea. An entirely different type of adequation is established here, between the race defined as "tribe" and smooth space defined as "milieu." A tribe in the desert instead of a universal subject within the horizon of all-encompassing Being. Kenneth White recently stressed this dissymmetrical complementarity between a race-tribe (the Celts, those who feel they are Celts) and a milieu-space (the Orient, the Gobi desert...). White demonstrates that this strange composite, the marriage of the Celt and the Orient, inspires a properly nomad thought that sweeps up English literature and constitutes American literature. 47 We immediately see the dangers, the profound ambiguities accompanying in this enterprise, as if each effort and each creation faced a possible infamy. For what can be done to prevent the theme of a race from turning into a racism, a dominant and all-encompassing fascism, or into a sect and a folklore, microfascisms? And what can be done to prevent the oriental pole from becoming a phantasy that reactivates all the fascisms in a different way, and also all the folklores, yoga, Zen, and karate? It is certainly not enough to travel to escape phantasy, and it is certainly not by invoking a past, real or mythical, that one avoids racism. But here again, the criteria for making the distinction are simple, whatever the de facto mixes that obscure them at a given level, at a given moment. The race-tribe exists only at the level of an oppressed race, and in the name of the oppression it suffers: there is no race but inferior, minoritarian; there is no dominant race; a race is defined not by its purity but rather by the impurity conferred upon it by a system of domination. Bastard and mixed-blood are the true names of race. Rimbaud said it all on this point: only he or she can invoke race who says, "I have always been of an inferior race... I am of an inferior race for all eternity. . . There I am on the Breton shore ... I am a beast, a nigger . . . I am of a distant race: my ancestors were Norsemen." 48 In the same way that race is not something to be rediscovered, the Orient is not something to be imitated: it only exists in the construction of a smooth space, just as race only exists in the constitu

All of thought is a becoming, a double becoming, rather than the attribute of a Subject and the representation of a Whole. A XIOM II. *The war machine is the invention of the nomads (insofar as it is * *exterior to the State apparatus and distinct from the military institu-  tion). As such, the war machine has three aspects, a spatiogeographic  aspect, an arithmetic or algebraic aspect, and an affective aspect.* P ROPOSITION V. *Nomad existence necessarily effectuates the conditions * *of the war machine in space.* The nomad has a territory; he follows customary paths; he goes from one point to another; he is not ignorant of points (water points, dwelling points, assembly points, etc.). But the question is what in nomad life is a principle and what is only a consequence. To begin with, although the points determine paths, they are strictly subordinated to the paths they determine, the reverse of what happens with the sedentary. The water point is reached only in order to be left behind; every point is a relay and exists only as a relay. A path is always between two points, but the in-bet ween has taken on all the consistency and enjoys both an autonomy and a direction of its own. The life of the nomad is the intermezzo. Even the ele ments of his dwelling are conceived in terms of the trajectory that is for ever mobilizing them. 49 The nomad is not at all the same as the migrant; for the migrant goes principally from one point to another, even if the sec ond point is uncertain, unforeseen, or not well localized. But the nomad goes from point to point only as a consequence and as a factual necessity; in principle, points for him are relays along a trajectory. Nomads and migrants can mix in many ways, or form a common aggregate; their causes and conditions are no less distinct for that (for example, those who joined Mohammed at Medina had a choice between a nomadic or bedouin pledge, and a pledge of hegira or emigration). 50 Second, even though the nomadic trajectory may follow trails or cus tomary routes, it does not fulfill the function of the sedentary road, which is to *parcel out a closed space to people, *assigning each person a share and regulating the communication between shares. The nomadic trajectory does the opposite: it *distributes people (or animals) in an open space, *one that is indefinite and noncommunicating. The *nomos *came to designate the law, but that was originally because it was distribution, a mode of distri bution. It is a very special kind of distribution, one without division into shares, in a space without borders or enclosure. The *nomos *is the consis tency of a fuzzy aggregate: it is in this sense that it stands in opposition to the law or the *polls, *as the backcountry, a mountainside, or the vague expanse around a city ("either nomos or polis"). 51 Therefore, and this is the

0 1227: TREATISE ON NOMADOLOGY—THE WAR MACHINE □ 381 third point, there is a significant difference between the spaces: sedentary space is striated, by walls, enclosures, and roads between enclosures, while nomad space is smooth, marked only by "traits" that are effaced and dis placed with the trajectory. Even the lamellae of the desert slide over each other, producing an inimitable sound. The nomad distributes himself in a smooth space; he occupies, inhabits, holds that space; that is his territorial principle. It is therefore false to define the nomad by movement. Toynbee is profoundly right to suggest that the nomad is on the contrary *he who does  not move. *Whereas the migrant leaves behind a milieu that has become amorphous or hostile, the nomad is one who does not depart, does not want to depart, who clings to the smooth space left by the receding forest, where the steppe or the desert advances, and who invents nomadism as a response to this challenge. 52 Of course, the nomad moves, but while seated, and he is only seated while moving (the Bedouin galloping, knees on the saddle, sit ting on the soles of his upturned feet, "a feat of balance"). The nomad knows how to wait, he has infinite patience. Immobility and speed, catato nia and rush, a "stationary process," station as process—these traits of Kleist's are eminently those of the nomad. It is thus necessary to make a distinction between *speed *and *movement: *a movement may be very fast, but that does not give it speed; a speed may be very slow, or even immobile, yet it is still speed. Movement is extensive; speed is intensive. Movement designates the relative character of a body considered as "one," and which goes from point to point; *speed, on the contrary, constitutes the absolute  character of a body whose irreducible parts (atoms) occupy or fill a smooth  space in the manner of a vortex, *with the possibility of springing up at any point. (It is therefore not surprising that reference has been made to spiri tual voyages effected without relative movement, but in intensity, in one place: these are part of nomadism.) In short, we will say by convention that only nomads have absolute movement, in other words, speed; vortical or swirling movement is an essential feature of their war machine. It is in this sense that nomads have no points, paths, or land, even though they do by all appearances. If the nomad can be called the Deterritorialized par excellence, it is precisely because there is no reterritorialization *after-  ward*as with the migrant, or upon *something else *as with the sedentary (the sedentary's relation with the earth is mediatized by something else, a prop erty regime, a State apparatus). With the nomad, on the contrary, it is deterritorialization that constitutes the relation to the earth, to such a degree that the nomad reterritorializes on deterritorialization itself. It is the earth that deterritorializes itself, in a way that provides the nomad with a territory. The land ceases to be land, tending to become simply ground  *(sol) *or support. The earth does not become deterritorialized in its global and relative movement, but at specific locations, at the spot where the for

Hubac is right to say that nomadism is explainable less by universal changes in climate (which relate instead to migrations) as by the "divagation of local cli mates." 53 The nomads are there, on the land, wherever there forms a smooth space that gnaws, and tends to grow, in all directions. The nomads inhabit these places; they remain in them, and they themselves make them grow, for it has been established that the nomads make the desert no less than they are made by it. They are vectors of deterritorialization. They add desert to desert, steppe to steppe, by a series of local operations whose ori entation and direction endlessly vary. 54 The sand desert has not only oases, which are like fixed points, but also rhizomatic vegetation that is tempo rary and shifts location according to local rains, bringing changes in the direction of the crossings. 55 The same terms are used to describe ice deserts as sand deserts: there is no line separating earth and sky; there is no inter mediate distance, no perspective or contour; visibility is limited; and yet there is an extraordinarily fine topology that relies not on points or objects but rather on haecceities, on sets of relations (winds, undulations of snow or sand, the song of the sand or the creaking of ice, the tactile qualities of both). It is a tactile space, or rather "haptic," a sonorous much more than a visual space. 56 The variability, the polyvocality of directions, is an essential feature of smooth spaces of the rhizome type, and it alters their cartogra phy. The nomad, nomad space, is localized and not delimited. What is both limited and limiting is striated space, the *relative global: *it is limited in its parts, which are assigned constant directions, are oriented in relation to one another, divisible by boundaries, and can interlink; what is limiting  *{limes *or wall, and no longer boundary) is this aggregate in relation to the smooth spaces it "contains," whose growth it slows or prevents, and which it restricts or places outside. Even when the nomad sustains its effects, he does not belong to this relative global, where one passes from one point to another, from one region to another. Rather, he is in a *local absolute, *an absolute that is manifested locally, and engendered in a series of local oper ations of varying orientations: desert, steppe, ice, sea. Making the absolute appear in a particular place—is that not a very gen eral characteristic of religion (recognizing that the nature of the appear ance, and the legitimacy, or lack thereof, of the images that reproduce it are open to debate)? But the sacred place of religion is fundamentally a center that repels the obscure *nomos. *The absolute of religion is essentially a hori zon that encompasses, and, if the absolute itself appears at a particular place, it does so in order to establish a solid and stable center for the global. The encompassing role of smooth spaces (desert, steppe, or ocean) in monotheism has been frequently noted. In short, religion converts the absolute. Religion is in this sense a piece in the State apparatus (in both of

Limiting ourselves to this opposition between points of view, it may be observed that nomads do not provide a favorable terrain for religion; the man of war is always committing an offense against the priest or the god. The nomads have a vague, literally vagabond "monotheism," and content themselves with that, and with their ambulant fires. The nomads have a sense of the absolute, but a singularly atheistic one. The universalist reli gions that have had dealings with nomads—Moses, Mohammed, even Christianity with the Nestorian heresy—have always encountered prob lems in this regard, and have run up against what they have termed obsti nate impiety. These religions are not, in effect, separable from a firm and constant orientation, from an imperial de jure State, even, and especially, in the absence of a de facto State; they have promoted an ideal of sedentari-zation and addressed themselves more to the migrant components than the nomadic ones. Even early Islam favored the theme of the hegira, or migration, over nomadism; rather, it was through certain schisms (such as the Kharijl movement) that it won over the Arab or Berber nomads. 57 However, it does not exhaust the question to establish a simple opposi tion between two points of view, religion-nomadism. For monotheistic religion, at the deepest level of its tendency to project a universal or spiri tual State over the entire ecumenon, is not without ambivalence or fringe areas; it goes beyond even the ideal limits of the State, even the imperial State, entering a more indistinct zone, an outside of States where it has the possibility of undergoing a singular mutation or adaptation. We are refer ring to religion as an element in a war machine and the idea of holy war as the motor of that machine. *The prophet, *as opposed to the state personality of the king and the religious personality of the priest, directs the movement by which a religion becomes a war machine or passes over to the side of such a machine. It has often been said that Islam, and the prophet Moham med, performed such a conversion of religion and constituted a veritable esprit de corps: in the formula of Georges Bataille, "early Islam, a society reduced to the military enterprise." This is what the West invokes in order to justify its antipathy toward Islam. Yet the Crusades were a properly Christian adventure of this type. The prophets may very well condemn nomad life; the war machine may very well favor the movement of migration and the ideal of establishment; religion in general may very well

0 384 □ 1227: TREATISE ON NOMADOLOGY—THE WAR MACHINE compensate for its specific deterritorialization with a spiritual and even physical reterritorialization, which in the case of the holy war assumes the well-directed character of a conquest of the holy lands as the center of the world. Despite all that, when religion sets itself up as a war machine, it mobilizes and liberates a formidable charge of nomadism or absolute deterritorialization; it doubles the migrant with an accompanying nomad, or with the potential nomad the migrant is in the process of becoming; and finally, it turns its dream of an absolute State back against the State-form. 58 And this turning-against is no less a part of the "essence" of religion than that dream. The history of the Crusades is marked by the most astonishing series of directional changes: the firm orientation toward the Holy Land as a center to reach often seems nothing more than a pretext. But it would be wrong to say that the play of self-interest, or economic, commercial, or political factors, diverted the crusade from its pure path. The idea of the crusade *in itself implies this variability of directions, *broken and changing, and intrinsically possesses all these factors or all these variables from the moment it turns religion into a war machine and simultaneously utilizes and gives rise to the corresponding nomadism. 59 The necessity of main taining the most rigorous of distinctions between sedentaries, migrants, and nomads does not preclude de facto mixes; on the contrary, it makes them all the more necessary in turn. And it is impossible to think of the gen eral process of sedentarization that vanquished the nomads without also envisioning the gusts of local nomadization that carried off sedentaries and doubled migrants (notably, to the benefit of religion). Smooth or nomad space lies between two striated spaces: that of the for est, with its gravitational verticals, and that of agriculture, with its grids and generalized parallels, its now independent arborescence, its art of extracting the tree and wood from the forest. But being "between" also means that smooth space is controlled by these two flanks, which limit it, oppose its development, and assign it as much as possible a communica-tional role; or, on the contrary, it means that it turns against them, gnawing away at the forest on one side, on the other side gaining ground on the cultivated lands, affirming a noncommunicating force or a force of *divergence *like a "wedge" digging in. The nomads turn first against the forest and the mountain dwellers, then descend upon the farmers. What we have here is something like the flipside or the outside of the State-form—but in what sense? This form, as a global and relative space, implies a certain number of components: forest-clearing of fields; agriculture-grid laying; animal raising subordinated to agricultural work and sedentary food production; commerce based on a constellation of town-country *(polis-nomos) *communications. When historians inquire into the reasons for the victory of the West over the Orient, they primarily mention the following characteris

Quite to the contrary, a more rigid agency becomes necessary in order to retain and reunite the various components plied by escape vectors. States always have the same composition; if there is even one truth in the political philosophy of Hegel, it is that every State carries within itself the essential moments of its existence. States are made up not only of people but also of wood, fields, gardens, animals, and commodities. There is a unity of *composition *of all States, but States have neither the same *development *nor the same *organization. *In the Orient, the compo nents are much more disconnected, disjointed, necessitating a great immu table Form to hold them together: "despotic formations," Asian or African, are rocked by incessant revolts, by secessions and dynastic changes, which nevertheless do not affect the immutability of the form. In the West, on the other hand, the interconnectedness of the components makes possible transformations of the State-form through revolution. It is true that the idea of revolution itself is ambiguous; it is Western insofar as it relates to a transformation of the State, but Eastern insofar as it envisions the destruc tion, the abolition of the State. 61 The great empires of the Orient, Africa, and America run up against wide-open smooth spaces that penetrate them and maintain gaps between their components (the *nomos *does not become countryside, the countryside does not communicate with the town, large-scale animal raising is the affair of the nomads, etc.): the oriental State is in direct confrontation with a nomad war machine. This war machine may fall back to the road of integration and proceed solely by revolt and dynastic change; nevertheless, it is the war machine, as nomad, that invents the abolitionist dream and reality. Western States are much more sheltered in their striated space and consequently have much more latitude in holding their components together; they confront the nomads only indirectly, through the intermediary of the migrations the nomads trigger or adopt as their stance. 62 One of the fundamental tasks of the State is to striate the space over which it reigns, or to utilize smooth spaces as a means of communication in the service of striated space. It is a vital concern of every State not only to vanquish nomadism but to control migrations and, more generally, to establish a zone of rights over an entire "exterior," over all of the flows traversing the ecumenon. If it can help it, the State does not dissociate itself

0 386 □ 1227: TREATISE ON NOMADOLOGY—THE WAR MACHINE from a process of capture of flows of all kinds, populations, commodities or commerce, money or capital, etc. There is still a need for fixed paths in well-defined directions, which restrict speed, regulate circulation, relativize movement, and measure in detail the relative movements of sub jects and objects. That is why Paul Virilio's thesis is important, when he shows that "the political power of the State is *polis, *police, that is, manage ment of the public ways," and that "the gates of the city, its levies and duties, are barriers, filters against the fluidity of the masses, against the penetration power of migratory packs," people, animals, and goods. 63 Gravity, *gravitas, *such is the essence of the State. It is not at all that the State knows nothing of speed; but it requires that movement, even the fast est, cease to be the absolute state of a moving body occupying a smooth space, to become the relative characteristic of a "moved body" going from one point to another in a striated space. In this sense, the State never ceases to decompose, recompose, and transform movement, or to regulate speed. The State as town surveyor, converter, or highway interchange: the role of the engineer from this point of view. Speed and absolute movement are not without their laws, but they are the laws of the *nomos, *of the smooth space that deploys it, of the war machine that populates it. If the nomads formed the war machine, it was by inventing absolute speed, by being "synony mous" with speed. And each time there is an operation against the State— insubordination, rioting, guerrilla warfare, or revolution as act—it can be said that a war machine has revived, that a new nomadic potential has appeared, accompanied by the reconstitution of a smooth space or a man ner of being in space as though it were smooth (Virilio discusses the impor tance of the riot or revolutionary theme of "holding the street"). It is in this sense that the response of the State against all that threatens to move beyond it is to striate space. The State does not appropriate the war machine without giving even it the form of relative movement: this was the case with the model of the *fortress *as a regulator of movement, which was precisely the obstacle the nomads came up against, the stumbling block and parry by which absolute vortical movement was broken. Conversely, when a State does not succeed in striating its interior or neighboring space, the flows traversing that State necessarily adopt the stance of a war machine directed against it, deployed in a hostile or rebellious smooth space (even if other States are able to slip their striations in). This was the adventure of China: toward the end of the fourteenth century, and in spite of its very high level of technology in ships and navigation, it turned its back on its huge maritime space, saw its commercial flows turn against it and ally themselves with piracy, and was unable to react except by a politics of immobility, of the massive restriction of commerce, which only reinforced the connection between commerce and the war machine. 64

1227: TREATISE ON NOMADOLOGY—THE WAR MACHINE D 387 The situation is much more complicated than we have let on. The sea is perhaps principal among smooth spaces, the hydraulic model par excel lence. But the sea is also, of all smooth spaces, the first one attempts were made to striate, to transform into a dependency of the land, with its fixed routes, constant directions, relative movements, a whole counterhydraulic of channels and conduits. One of the reasons for the hegemony of the West was the power of its State apparatuses to striate the sea by combining the technologies of the North and the Mediterranean and by annexing the Atlantic. But this undertaking had the most unexpected result: the multi plication of relative movements, the intensification of relative speeds in striated space, ended up reconstituting a smooth space or absolute move ment. As Virilio emphasizes, the sea became the place of *the fleet in being, * where one no longer goes from one point to another, but rather holds space beginning from any point: instead of striating space, one occupies it with a vector of deterritorialization in perpetual motion. This modern strategy was communicated from the sea to the air, as the new smooth space, but also to the entire Earth considered as desert or sea. As converter and capturer, the State does not just relativize movement, it reimparts absolute movement. It does not just go from the smooth to the striated, it reconsti tutes smooth space; it reimparts smooth in the wake of the striated. It is true that this new nomadism accompanies a worldwide war machine whose organization exceeds the State apparatuses and passes into energy, military-industrial, and multinational complexes. We say this as a reminder that smooth space and the form of exteriority do not have an irre sistible revolutionary calling but change meaning drastically depending on the interactions they are part of and the concrete conditions of their exer cise or establishment (for example, the way in which total war and popular war, and even guerrilla warfare, borrow one another's methods). 65 P ROPOSITION VI. *Nomad existence necessarily implies the numerical * *elements of a war machine.* Tens, hundreds, thousands, myriads: all armies retain these decimal groupings, to the point that each time they are encountered it is safe to assume the presence of a military organization. Is this not the way an army deterritorializes its soldiers? An army is composed of units, companies, and divisions. The Numbers may vary in function, in combination; they may enter into entirely different strategies; but there is always a connection between the Number and the war machine. It is a question not of quantity but of organization or composition. When the State creates armies, it always applies this principle of numerical organization; but all it does is adopt the principle, at the same time as it appropriates the war machine. For so peculiar an idea—the numerical organization of people—came

0 388 D 1227: TREATISE ON NOMADOLOGY—THE WAR MACHINE from the nomads. It was the Hyksos, conquering nomads, who brought it to Egypt; and when Moses applied it to his people in exodus, it was on the advice of his nomad father-in-law, Jethro the Kenite, and was done in such a way as to constitute a war machine, the elements of which are described in the biblical book of Numbers. The *nomos *is fundamentally numerical, arithmetic. When Greek geometrism is contrasted with Indo-Arab arithmetism, it becomes clear that the latter implies a nomos opposable to the logos: not that the nomads "do" arithmetic or algebra, but because arithmetic and algebra arise in a strongly nomad influenced world. Up to now we have known three major types of human organization: *lin-* *eal, territorial, *and *numerical. *Lineal organization allows us to define so-called primitive societies. Clan lineages are essentially segments in action; they meld and divide, and vary according to the ancestor consid ered, the tasks, and the circumstances. Of course, number plays an impor tant role in the determination of lineage, or in the creation of new lineages—as does the earth, since a clan segmentarity is doubled by a tribal segmentarity. The earth is before all else the matter upon which the dynamic of lineages is inscribed, and the number, a means of inscription: the lineages write upon the earth and with the number, constituting a kind of "geodesy." Everything changes with State societies: it is often said that the territorial principle becomes dominant. One could also speak of deterritorialization, since the earth becomes an object, instead of being an active material element in combination with lineage. Property is precisely the deterritorialized relation between the human being and the earth; this is so whether property constitutes a good belonging to the State, superposed upon continuing possession by a lineal community, or whether it itself becomes a good belonging to private individuals constituting a new community. In both cases (and according to the two poles of the State), something like an overcoding of the earth replaces geodesy. Of course, line ages remain very important, and numbers take on their own importance. But what moves to the forefront is a "territorial" organization, in the sense that all the segments, whether of lineage, land, or number, are taken up by  *an astronomical space or a geometrical extension *that overcodes them— but certainly not in the same way in the archaic imperial State and in mod ern States. The archaic State envelops a *spatium *with a summit, a differentiated space with depth and levels, whereas modern States (begin ning with the Greek city-state) develop a homogeneous *extensio *with an immanent center, divisible homologous parts, and symmetrical and reversible relations. Not only do the two models, the astronomical and the geometrical, enter into intimate mixes, but even when they are supposedly pure, both imply the subordination of lineages and numbers to this metric power, as it appears either in the *imperial spatium *or in the *political*

0 1227: TREATISE ON NOMADOLOGY—THE WAR MACHINE D 389 *extension *Arithmetic, the number, has always had a decisive role in the State apparatus: this is so even as early as the imperial bureaucracy, with the three conjoined operations of the census, taxation, and election. It is even truer of modern forms of the State, which in developing utilized all the calculation techniques that were springing up at the border between mathematical science and social technology (there is a whole social calcu lus at the basis of political economy, demography, the organization of work, etc.). This arithmetic element of the State found its specific power in the treatment of all kinds of matter: primary matters (raw materials), the secondary matter of wrought objects, or the ultimate matter constituted by the human population. Thus the number has always served to gain mastery over matter, to control its variations and movements, in other words, to submit them to the spatiotemporal framework of the State—either the imperial *spatium, *or the modern *extensio.* *61* * *The State has a territorial principle, or a principle of deterritorialization, that links the number to metric magnitudes (taking into account the increasingly complex metrics effecting the overcoding). We do not believe that the conditions of inde pendence or autonomy of the Number are to be found in the State, even though all the factors of its development are present. The *Numbering Number, *in other words, autonomous arithmetic organ ization, implies neither a superior degree of abstraction nor very large quantities. It relates only to conditions of possibility constituted by nomadism and to conditions of effectuation constituted by the war machine. It is in State armies that the problem of the treatment of large quantities arises, in relation to other matters; but the war machine operates with small quantities that it treats using numbering numbers. These num bers appear as soon as one distributes something in space, instead of divid ing up space or distributing space itself. The number becomes a subject. The independence of the number in relation to space is a result not of abstraction but of the concrete nature of smooth space, which is occupied without itself being counted. The number is no longer a means of counting or measuring but of moving: it is the number itself that moves through smooth space. There is undoubtedly a geometry of smooth space: but as we have seen, it is a minor, operative geometry, a geometry of the trait. The more independent space is from a metrics, the more independent the num ber is from space. Geometry as a royal science has little importance for the war machine (its only importance is in State armies, and for sedentary for tification, but it leads generals to serious defeats). 68 The number becomes a principle whenever it occupies a smooth space, and is deployed within it as subject, instead of measuring a striated space. The number is the mobile occupant, the movable *(meuble) *in smooth space, as opposed to the geometry of the immovable *(immeuble) *in striated space. The nomadic

0 390 □ 1227: TREATISE ON NOMADOLOGY—THE WAR MACHINE numerical unit is the ambulant fire, and not the tent, which is still too much of an immovable: "The fire takes precedence over the yurt." The number ing number is no longer subordinated to metric determinations or geomet rical dimensions, but has only a dynamic relation with geographical directions: it is a directional number, not a dimensional or metric one. Nomad organization is indissolubly arithmetic and directional; quantity is everywhere, tens, hundreds, direction is everywhere, left, right: the numer ical chief is also the chief of the left or the right. 69 The numbering number is rhythmic, not harmonic. It is not related to cadence or measure: it is only in State armies, and for reasons of discipline and show, that one marches in cadence; but autonomous numerical organization finds its meaning else where, whenever it is necessary to establish an *order of displacement *on the steppe, the desert—at the point where the lineages of the forest dwellers and the figures of the State lose their relevance. "He moved with the ran dom walk which made only those sounds natural to the desert. Nothing in his passage would [indicate] that human flesh moved there. It was a way of walking so deeply conditioned in him that he didn't need to think about it. The feet moved of themselves, no measurable rhythm to their pacing." 70 In the war machine and nomadic existence, the number is no longer num bered, but becomes a Cipher *(Chiffre), *and it is in this capacity that it con stitutes the "esprit de corps" and invents the secret and its outgrowths (strategy, espionage, war ruses, ambush, diplomacy, etc.). A ciphered, rhythmic, directional, autonomous, movable, numbering number: the war machine is like the necessary consequence of nomadic organization (Moses experienced it, with all its consequences). Some peo ple nowadays are too eager to criticize this numerical organization, denouncing it as a military or even concentration-camp society where peo ple are no longer anything more than deterritorialized "numbers." But that is false. Horror for horror, the numerical organization of people is certainly no cruder than the lineal or State organizations. Treating people like num bers is not necessarily worse than treating them like trees to prune, or geo metrical figures to shape and model. Moreover, the use of the number as a numeral, as a statistical element, is proper to the numbered number of the State, not to the numbering number. And the world of the concentration camp operates as much by lineages and territories as by numeration. The question is not one of good or bad but of specificity. The specificity of numerical organization rests on the nomadic mode of existence and the war machine function. The numbering number is distinct both from lineal codes and State overcoding. Arithmetic composition, on the one hand, selects, extracts from the lineages the elements that will enter into nomadism and the war machine and, on the other hand, directs them against the State apparatus, opposing a machine and an existence to the

0 1227: TREATISE ON NOMADOLOGY—THE WAR MACHINE D 391 State apparatus, drawing a deterritorialization that cuts across both the lin eal territorialities and the territory or deterritoriality of the State. A first characteristic of the numbering, nomadic or war, number is that it is always complex, that is, articulated. A complex of numbers every time. It is exactly for this reason that it in no way implies large, homogenized quantities, like State numbers or the numbered number, but rather pro duces its effect of immensity by its fine articulation, in other words, by its distribution of heterogeneity in a free space. Even State armies do not do away with this principle when they deal with large numbers (despite the predominance of "base" 10). The Roman legion was a number made up of numbers, articulated in such a way that the segments became mobile, and the figures geometrical, changing, transformational. The complex or artic ulated number comprises not only men but necessarily weapons, animals, and vehicles. The arithmetic base unit is therefore a unit of assemblage, for example, man-horse-bow, lxl X 1, according to the formula that carried the Scythians to triumph; and the formula becomes more complicated to the extent that certain "weapons" assemble or articulate several men or animals, as in the case of the chariot with two horses and two men, one to drive and the other to throw, 2 X 1 X 2 = 1; or in the case of the famous two-handled shield of the hoplite reform, which soldered together human chains. However small the unit, it is articulated. The numbering number always has several bases at the same time. It is also necessary to take into account arithmetic relations that are external yet still contained in the number, expressing the proportion of combatants among the members of a lineage or tribe, the role of reserves and stocks, the upkeep of people, things, and animals. *Logistics *is the art of these external relations, which are no less a part of the war machine than the internal relations *of strategy, * in other words, the composition of combat units in relation to one another. The two together constitute the science of the articulation of numbers of war. Every assemblage has this strategic aspect and this logistical aspect. But the numbering number has a second, more secret, characteristic. Everywhere, the war machine displays a curious process of arithmetic rep lication or doubling, as if it operated along two nonsymmetrical and nonequal series. *On the one hand, *the lineages are indeed organized and reshuffled numerically; a numerical composition is superimposed upon the lineages in order to bring the new principle into predominance. But *on  the other hand, *men are simultaneously extracted from each lineage to form a special numerical body—as if the new numerical composition of the lineage-body could not succeed without the constitution of a body proper to it, itself numerical. We believe that this is not an accidental phenomenon but rather an essential constituent of the war machine, a necessary operation for the autonomy of the number: the number of the

0 392 □ 1227: TREATISE ON NOMADOLOGY—THE WAR MACHINE body must have as its correlate a body of the number; the number must be doubled according to two complementary operations. For the social body to be numerized, the number must form a special body. When Genghis Khan undertook his great composition of the steppe, he numerically or ganized the lineages, and the fighters in each lineage, placing them under a cipher and a chief (groups of ten with decurions, groups of one hundred with centurions, groups of one thousand with chiliarchs). He also extracted from each arithmetized lineage a small number of men who were to consti tute his personal guard, in other words, a dynamic formation comprising a staff, commissars, messengers, and diplomats ("antrustions"). 71 One is never without the other: a double deterritorialization, the second of which is to a higher power. When Moses undertook his great composition of the desert—where the influence he felt from the nomads was necessarily stronger than that of Yahweh—he took a census of each tribe and or ganized them numerically; he also decreed a law according to which the firstborn of each tribe at that particular time belonged by right to Yahweh. As these firstborn were obviously still too young, their role in the Number was transferred to a special tribe, the Levites, who provided the body of the Number or the special guard of the ark; and as the Levites were less numer ous than the new firstborn of the tribes taken together, the excess firstborn had to be bought back by the tribes in the form of taxes (bringing us back to a fundamental aspect of logistics). The war machine would be unable to function without this double series: it is necessary both that numerical composition replace lineal organization and that it conjure away the ter ritorial organization of the State. Power in the war machine is defined ac cording to this double series: power is no longer based on segments and centers, on the potential resonance of centers and overcoding of segments, but on these relations internal to the Number and independent of quantity. Tensions or power struggles are also a result of this: between Moses' tribes and the Levites, between Genghis's "noyans" and "antrustions." This is not simply a protest on the part of lineages wishing to regain their former autonomy; nor is it the prefiguration of a struggle for control over a State apparatus. It is a tension inherent in the war machine, in its special power, and in the particular limitations placed on the power of the "chief." Thus numerical composition, or the numbering number, implies several operations: the arithmetization of the starting aggregates or sets (the line ages); the union of the extracted subsets (the constitution of groups often, one hundred, etc.); and the formation by substitution of another set in cor respondence with the united set (the special body). It is this last operation that implies the most variety and originality in nomad existence. The same problem arises even in State armies, when the war machine is appropriated by the State. In effect, if the arithmetization of the social body has as its cor

0 1227: TREATISE ON NOMADOLOGY—THE WAR MACHINE d 393 relate the formation of a distinct special body, itself arithmetic, this special body may be constructed in several ways: (1) from a privileged lineage or tribe, the dominance of which subsequently takes on a new meaning (the case of Moses, with the Levites); (2) from representatives of each lineage, who subsequently serve also as hostages (the firstborn; this would actually be the Asian case, or the case of Genghis); (3) from a totally different ele ment, one exterior to the base society, slaves, foreigners, or people of another religion (this was already the case as early as the Saxon regime, in which the king used Frankish slaves to compose his special body; but Islam is the prime example, even inspiring a specific sociological category, that of "military slavery": the Mameluks of Egypt, slaves from the steppe or the Caucasus who were purchased at a very early age by the sultan; or the Otto man Janissaries, who came from Christian communities). 72 Is this not the origin of an important theme, "the nomads as child stealers"? It is clear, especially in the last example, how the special body is instituted as an element determinant of power in the war machine. The war machine and nomadic existence have to ward off two things simultane ously: a return of the lineal aristocracy and the formation of imperial functionaries. What complicates everything is that the State itself has often been determined in such a way as to use slaves as high functionaries. As we shall see, the reasons for this varied, and although the two currents con verged in armies, they came from two distinct sources. For the power of slaves, foreigners, or captives in a war machine of nomadic origin is very different from the power of lineal aristocracies, as well as from that of State functionaries and bureaucrats. They are "commissars," emissaries, diplo mats, spies, strategists, and logisticians, sometimes smiths. They cannot be explained away as a "whim of the sultan." On the contrary, it is the possibil ity of the war chief having whims that is explained by the objective exis tence and necessity of this special numerical body, this Cipher that has value only in relation to a *nomos. *There is both a deterritorialization and a becoming proper to the war machine; the special body, in particular the slave-infidel-foreigner, is the one who *becomes *a soldier and believer while remaining deterritorialized in relation to the lineages and the State. You have to be born an infidel to become a believer; you have to be born a slave to become a soldier. Specific schools or institutions are needed for this pur pose: the special body is an invention proper to the war machine, which States always utilize, adapting it so totally to their own ends that it becomes unrecognizable, or restituting it in bureaucratic staff form, or in the tech nocratic form of very special bodies, or in "esprit de corps" that serve the State as much as they resist it, or among the commissars who double the State as much as they serve it. It is true that the nomads have no history; they only have a geography.

0 394 □ 1227: TREATISE ON NOMADOLOGY—THE WAR MACHINE And the defeat of the nomads was such, so complete, that history is one with the triumph of States. We have witnessed, as a result, a generalized cri tique dismissing the nomads as incapable of any innovation, whether tech nological or metallurgical, political or metaphysical. Historians, bourgeois or Soviet (Grousset or Vladimirtsov), consider the nomads a pitiable seg ment of humanity that understands nothing: not technology, to which it supposedly remained indifferent; not agriculture, not the cities and States it destroyed or conquered. It is difficult to see, however, how the nomads could have triumphed in war if they did not possess strong metallurgical capabilities (the idea that the nomads received their technical weapons and political counseling from renegades from an imperial State is highly im probable). It is difficult to see how the nomads could have undertaken to destroy cities and States, except in the name of a nomad organization and a war machine defined not by ignorance but by their positive characteristics, by their specific space, by a composition all their own that broke with line ages and warded off the State-form. History has always dismissed the nomads. Attempts have been made to apply a properly military category to the war machine (that of "military democracy") and a properly sedentary category to nomadism (that of "feudalism"). But these two hypotheses pre suppose a territorial principle: either that an imperial State appropriates the war machine, distributing land to warriors as a benefit of their position  *(cleroi *and false fiefs), or that property, once it has become private, in itself posits relations of dependence among the property owners constituting the army (true fiefs and vassalage). 73 In both cases, the number is subordinated to an "immobile" fiscal organization, in order to establish which land can be or has been ceded, as well as to set the taxes owed by the beneficiaries themselves. There is no doubt that nomad organization and the war machine deal with these same problems, both the level of land and of taxa tion (in which the nomadic warriors were great innovators, despite what is said to the contrary). But they invent a territoriality and a "movable" fiscal organization that testify to the autonomy of a numerical principle: there can be a confusion or combination of the systems, but the specificity of the nomadic system remains the subordination of land to numbers that are displaced and deployed, and of taxation to relations internal to those num bers (already with Moses, for example, taxation played a role in the relation between the numerical bodies and the special body of the number). In short, military democracy and feudalism, far from explaining the numeri cal composition of the nomads, instead testify to what may survive of them in sedentary regimes.

0 1227: TREATISE ON NOMADOLOGY—THE WAR MACHINE □ 395 A distinction can always be made between weapons and tools on the basis of their usage (destroying people or producing goods). But although this extrinsic distinction explains certain secondary adaptations of a tech nical object, it does not preclude a general convertibility between the two groups, to the extent that it seems very difficult to propose an intrinsic dif ference between weapons and tools. The types of percussion, as defined by Andre Leroi-Gourhan, are found on both sides. "For ages on end agricul tural implements and weapons of war must have remained identical." 74 Some have spoken of an "ecosystem," not only situated at the origin, in which work tools and weapons of war exchange their determinations: it seems that the same *machinicphylum *traverses both. And yet we have the feeling that there are many internal differences, even if they are not intrin sic, in other words, logical or conceptual, and even if they remain approxi mate. As a first approximation, weapons have a privileged relation with projection. Anything that throws or is thrown is fundamentally a weapon, and propulsion is its essential moment. The weapon is ballistic; the very notion of the "problem" is related to the war machine. The more mecha nisms of projection a tool has, the more it behaves like a weapon, poten tially or simply metaphorically. In addition, tools are constantly compen sating for the projective mechanisms they possess, or else they adapt them to other ends. It is true that missile weapons, in the strict sense, whether projected or projecting, are only one kind among others; but even hand held weapons require a usage of the hand and arm different from that required by tools, a projective usage exemplified in the martial arts. The tool, on the other hand, is much more introceptive, introjective: it prepares a matter from a distance, in order to bring it to a state of equilibrium or to appropriate it for a form of interiority. Action at a distance exists in both cases, but in one case it is centrifugal and in the other, centripetal. One could also say that the tool encounters resistances, to be conquered or put to use, while the weapon has to do with counterattack, to be avoided or invented (the counterattack is in fact the precipitating and inventive factor in the war machine, to the extent that it is not simply reducible to a quanti tative rivalry or defensive parade). Second, weapons and tools do not "tendentially" (approximately) have the same relation to movement, to speed. It is yet another essential contri bution of Paul Virilio to have stressed this weapon-speed complemen tarity: the weapon invents speed, or the discovery of speed invents the weapon (the projective character of weapons is the result). The war machine releases a vector of speed so specific to it that it needs a special name; it is not only the power of destruction, but "dromocracy" (= *nomos). * Among other advantages, this idea articulates a new mode of distinction between the hunt and war. For it is certain not only that war does not derive

0 396 □ 1227: TREATISE ON NOMADOLOGY—THE WAR MACHINE from the hunt but also that the hunt does not promote weapons: either war evolved in the sphere of indistinction and convertibility between weapons and tools, or it used to its own advantage weapons already distinguished, already constituted. As Virilio says, war in no way appears when man applies to man the relation of the *hunter *to the animal, but on the contrary when he captures the force of the *hunted *animal and enters an entirely new relation to man, that of war (enemy, no longer prey). It is therefore not sur prising that the war machine was the invention of the animal-raising nomads: animal breeding and training are not to be confused either with the primitive hunt or with sedentary domestication, but are in fact the dis covery of a projecting and projectile system. Rather than operating by blow-by-blow violence, or constituting a violence "once and for all," the war machine, with breeding and training, institutes an entire economy of violence, in other words, a way of making violence durable, even unlim ited. "Bloodletting, immediate killing, run contrary to the unlimited usage of violence, that is, to its economy.... *The economy of violence is not that of  the hunter in the animal raiser, but that of the hunted animal. *In horseback riding, one conserves the kinetic energy, the speed of the horse, and no longer its proteins (the motor, and no longer the flesh).. . . Whereas in the hunt the hunter's aim was to arrest the movement of wild animality through systematic slaughter, the animal breeder [sets about] conserving it, and, by means of training, the rider joins with this movement, orienting it and provoking its acceleration." The technological motor would develop this tendency further, but "horseback riding was the first projector of the warrior, his first system of arms." 75 Whence becoming-animal in the war machine. Does this mean that the war machine did not exist before horse back riding and the cavalry? That is not the issue. The issue is that the war machine implies the release of a Speed vector that becomes a free or inde pendent variable; this does not occur in the hunt, where speed is associated primarily with the hunted animal. It is possible for this race vector to be released in an infantry, without recourse to horseback riding; it is possible, moreover, for there to be horseback riding, but as a means of transporta tion or even of portage having nothing to do with the free vector. In any event, what the warrior borrows from the animal is more the idea of the motor than the model of the prey. He does not generalize the idea of the prey by applying it to the enemy; he abstracts the idea of the motor, apply ing it to himself. Two objections immediately arise. According to the first, the war machine possesses as much weight and gravity as it does speed (the distinc tion between the heavy and the light, the dissymmetry between defense and attack, the opposition between rest and tension). But it would be easy to demonstrate that phenomena of "temporization," and even of immobility

0 1227: TREATISE ON NOMADOLOGY—THE WAR MACHINE □ 397 and catatonia, so important in wars, relate in certain cases to a component of pure speed. And the rest of the time, they relate to the conditions under which State apparatuses appropriate the war machine, notably by arrang ing a striated space where opposing forces can come to an equilibrium. It can happen that speed is abstracted as the property of a projectile, a bullet or artillery shell, which condemns the weapon itself, and the soldier, to immobility (for example, immobility in the First World War). But an equi librium of forces is a phenomenon of resistance, whereas the counterattack implies a rush or change of speed that breaks the equilibrium: it was the tank that regrouped all of the operations in the speed vector and recreated a smooth space for movement by uprooting men and arms. 76 The opposite objection is more complex: it is that speed does indeed seem to be as much a part of the tool as of the weapon, and is no way specific to the war machine. The history of the motor is not only military. But per haps there is too much of a tendency to think in terms of quantities of movement, instead of seeking qualitative models. The two ideal models of the motor are those of work and *free action. *Work is a motor cause that meets resistances, operates upon the exterior, is consumed and spent in its effect, and must be renewed from one moment to the next. Free action is also a motor cause, but one that has no resistance to overcome, operates only upon the mobile body itself, is not consumed in its effect, and contin ues from one moment to the next. Whatever its measure or degree, speed is relative in the first case, absolute in the second (the idea of a *perpetuum  mobile). *In work, what counts is the point of application of a resultant force exerted by the weight of a body considered as "one" (gravity), and the rela tive displacement of this point of application. In free action, what counts is the way in which the elements of the body escape gravitation to occupy absolutely a nonpunctuated space. Weapons and weapon handling seem to be linked to a free-action model, and tools to a work model. Linear dis placement, from one point to another, constitutes the relative movement of the tool, but it is the vortical occupation of a space that constitutes the absolute movement of the weapon. It is as though the weapon were moving, self-propelling, while the tool is moved. This link between tools and work remains obscured unless work receives the motor, or real, definition we have just given it. The tool does not define work; just the opposite. The tool presupposes work. It must be added that weapons, also, obviously imply a renewal of the cause, an expending or even disappearance in the effect, the encountering of external resistances, a displacement of force, etc. It would be futile to credit weapons with a magical power in contrast to the con straints of tools: weapons and tools are subject to the same laws, which define, precisely, their common sphere. But the principle behind all tech nology is to demonstrate that a technical element remains abstract,

0 398 □ 1227: TREATISE ON NOMADOLOGY—THE WAR MACHINE entirely undetermined, as long as one does not relate it to an *assemblage *it presupposes. It is the machine that is primary in relation to the technical element: not the technical machine, itself a collection of elements, but the social or collective machine, the machinic assemblage that determines what is a technical element at a given moment, what is its usage, extension, comprehension, etc. It is through the intermediary of assemblages that the *phylum *selects, qualifies, and even invents the technical elements. Thus one cannot speak of weapons or tools before defining the constituent assemblages they pre suppose and enter into. This is what we meant when we said that weapons and tools are not merely distinguished from one another in an extrinsic manner, and yet they have no distinctive intrinsic characteristics. They have internal (and not intrinsic) characteristics relating to the respective assemblages with which they are associated. What effectuates a free-action model is not the weapons in themselves and in their physical aspect but the "war machine" assemblage as formal cause of the weapons. And what effectuates the work model is not the tools but the "work machine" assem blage as formal cause of the tools. When we say that the weapon is insepara ble from a speed vector, while the tool remains tied to conditions of gravity, we are claiming only to signal a difference between two types of assem blage, a distinction that holds even if in the assemblage proper to it the tool is abstractly "faster," and the weapon abstractly "weightier." The tool is essentially tied to a genesis, a displacement, and an expenditure of force whose laws reside in work, while the weapon concerns only the exercise or manifestation of force in space and time, in conformity with free action. The weapon does not fall from the sky, and obviously assumes production, displacement, expenditure, and resistance. But this aspect relates to the common sphere of the weapon and the tool, and does not yet concern the specificity of the weapon, which appears only when force is considered in itself, when it is no longer tied to anything but the number, movement, space, or time, or *when speed is added to displacement.* *11* * *Concretely, a weapon as such relates not to the Work model but to the Free-Action model, with the assumption that the conditions of work are fulfilled else where. In short, from the point of view of force, the tool is tied to a gravity-displacement, weight-height system, and the weapon to a  *speed-perpetuum mobile *system (it is in this sense that it can be said that speed in itself is a "weapons system"). The very general primacy of the collective and machinic assemblage over the technical element applies generally, for tools as for weapons. Weapons and tools are consequences, nothing but consequences. It has often been remarked that a weapon is nothing outside of the combat organ ization it is bound up with. For example, "hoplite" weapons existed only by

The lance and the sword came into being in the Bronze Age only by virtue of the man-horse assem blage, which caused a lengthening of the dagger and pike, and made the first infantry weapons, the morning star and the battle-ax, obsolete. The stirrup, in turn, occasioned a new figure of the man-horse assemblage, entailing a new type of lance and new weapons; and this man-horse-stirrup constellation is itself variable, and has different effects depending on whether it is bound up with the general conditions of nomadism, or later readapted to the sedentary conditions of feudalism. The situation is exactly the same for the tool: once again, everything depends on an organi zation of work, and variable assemblages of human, animal, and thing. Thus the heavy plow exists as a specific tool only in a constellation where "long open fields" predominate, where the horse tends to replace the ox as draft animal, where the land begins to undergo triennial rotation, and where the economy becomes communal. Beforehand, the heavy plow may well have existed, but on the margins of other assemblages that did not bring out its specificity, that left unexploited its differential character with the scratch plow. 79 Assemblages are passional, they are compositions of desire. Desire has nothing to do with a natural or spontaneous determination; there is no desire but assembling, assembled, desire. The rationality, the efficiency, of an assemblage does not exist without the passions the assemblage brings into play, without the desires that constitute it as much as it constitutes them. Detienne has shown that the Greek phalanx was inseparable from a whole reversal of values, and from a passional mutation that drastically changed the relations between desire and the war machine. It is a case of man dismounting from the horse, and of the man-animal relation being replaced by a relation between men in an infantry assemblage that paves the way for the advent of the peasant-soldier, the citizen-soldier: the entire Eros of war changes, a group homosexual Eros tends to replace the zoosexual Eros of the horseman. Undoubtedly, whenever a State appropri ates the war machine, it tends to assimilate the education of the citizen to the training of the worker to the apprenticeship of the soldier. But if it is true that all assemblages are assemblages of desire, the question is whether the assemblages of war and work, considered in themselves, do not funda mentally mobilize passions of different orders. Passions are effectuations of desire that differ according to the assemblage: it is not the same justice or the same cruelty, the same pity, etc. The work regime is inseparable from an

400 □ 1227: TREATISE ON NOMADOLOGY—THE WAR MACHINE organization and a development of Form, corresponding to which is the formation of the subject. This is the passional regime of feeling as "the form of the worker." Feeling implies an evaluation of matter and its resis tances, a direction *(sens, *also "meaning") to form and its developments, an economy of force and its displacements, an entire gravity. But the regime of the war machine is on the contrary that *of affects, *which relate only to the moving body in itself, to speeds and compositions of speed among ele ments. Affect is the active discharge of emotion, the counterattack, whereas feeling is an always displaced, retarded, resisting emotion. Affects are projectiles just like weapons; feelings are introceptive like tools. There is a relation between the affect and the weapon, as witnessed not only in mythology but also in the *chanson degeste, *and the chivalric novel or novel of courtly love. Weapons are affects and affects weapons. From this stand point, the most absolute immobility, pure catatonia, is a part of the speed vector, is carried by this vector, which links the petrification of the act to the precipitation of movement. The knight sleeps on his mount, then departs like an arrow. Kleist is the author who best integrated these sudden catatonic fits, swoons, suspenses, with the utmost speeds of a war machine. He presents us with a becoming-weapon of the technical element simulta neous to a becoming-affect of the passional element (the Penthesilea equa tion). The martial arts have always subordinated weapons to speed, and above all to mental (absolute) speed; for this reason, they are also the arts of suspense and immobility. The affect passes through both extremes. Thus the martial arts do not adhere to a *code, *as an affair of the State, but follow  *ways, *which are so many paths of the affect; upon these ways, one learns to "unuse" weapons as much as one learns to use them, as if the power and cul tivation of the affect were the true goal of the assemblage, the weapon being only a provisory means. Learning to undo things, and to undo oneself, is proper to the war machine: the "not-doing" of the warrior, the undoing of the subject. A movement of decoding runs through the war machine, while overcoding solders the tool to an organization of work and of the State (the tool is never unlearned; one can only compensate for its absence). It is true that the martial arts continually invoke the center of gravity and the rules for its displacement. That is because these ways are not the ultimate ones. However far they go, they are still in the domain of Being, and only trans late absolute movements of another nature into the common space—those effectuated in the Void, not in nothingness, but in the smooth of the void where there is no longer any goal: attacks, counterattacks, and headlong plunges. 80 Still from the standpoint of the assemblage, there is an essential relation between tools and signs. That is because the work model that defines the tool belongs to the State apparatus. It has often been said that people in

0 1227: TREATISE ON NOMADOLOGY—THE WAR MACHINE □ 401 primitive societies do not, strictly speaking, work, even if their activities are very constrained and regulated; and the man of war, in his capacity as a man of war, does not work either (the "labors" of Hercules assume submis sion to a king). The technical element becomes a tool when it is abstracted from the territory and is applied to the earth as an object; but at the same time, the sign ceases to be inscribed upon the body and is written upon an immobile, objective matter. For there to be work, there must be a capture of activity by the State apparatus, and a semiotization of activity by writ ing. Hence the affinity between the assemblages signs-tools, and signs of writing-organization of work. Entirely different is the case of the weapon, which is in an essential relation with jewelry. Jewelry has undergone so many secondary adaptations that we no longer have a clear understanding of what it is. But something lights up in our mind when we are told that metalworking was the "barbarian," or nomad, art par excellence, and when we see these masterpieces of minor art. These fibulas, these gold or silver plaques, these pieces of jewelry, are attached to small movable objects; they are not only easy to transport, but pertain to the object only as object in motion. These plaques constitute traits of expression of pure speed, car ried on objects that are themselves mobile and moving. The relation between them is not that of form-matter but of motif-support, where the earth is no longer anything more than ground *(sol), *where there is no longer even any ground at all because the support is as mobile as the motif. They lend colors the speed of light, turning gold to red and silver to white light. They are attached to the horse's harness, the sheath of the sword, the warrior's garments, the handle of the weapon; they even decorate things used only once, such as arrowheads. Regardless of the effort or toil they imply, they are of the order of free action, related to pure mobility, and not of the order of work with its conditions of gravity, resistance, and expendi ture. The ambulant smith links metalworking to the weapon, and vice versa. Gold and silver have taken on many other functions but cannot be understood apart from this nomadic contribution made by the war machine, in which they are not matters but traits of expression appropriate to weapons (the whole mythology of war not only subsists in money but is the active factor in it). Jewels are the affects corresponding to weapons, that are swept up by the same speed vector. Metalworking, jewelry making, ornamentation, even decoration, do not form a writing, even though they have a power of abstraction that is in every way equal to that of writing. But this power is assembled differently. In the case of writing, the nomads had no need to create their own system; they borrowed that of their sedentary imperial neighbors, who even fur nished them with a phonetic transcription of their languages. 81 "The goldsmith's and silversmith's is the barbarian art par excellence; filigree

Scythian art, tied as it was to a nomadic and warlike economy that both used and repudiated a commerce reserved for foreigners, now moved toward this luxurious and decorative type of work. The barbarians. .. did not need to possess or create a precise code, such as for instance an elementary picto-ideographic one—still less a syllabic writ ing of their own, which would indeed have had to compete with the ones in use among their more advanced neighbors. Toward the fourth and third centuries B.C. the Scythian art of the Black Sea region thus tends naturally toward a graphic schematization of its forms, which makes them more of a linear ornamentation than a proto-writing." 82 Of course, one may write on jewelry, metal plaques, or even weapons, but only in the sense that one applies a preexisting writing system to these matters. The case *of runic writ-  ing *is more troubling because its origins seem exclusively tied to jewelry, fibulas, elements of metalworking, small movable objects. The point is that in its early period runic writing had only a weak communication value and a very restricted public function. Its secret character has led many to interpret it as magical writing. Rather, it is an affective semiotic, compris ing in particular: (1) signatures, as marks of possession or fabrication, and (2) short war or love messages. It constitutes a text that is "ornamental" rather than scriptural, "an invention with little utility, half-aborted," a sub stitute writing. It only takes on the value of writing during a second period, when monumental inscriptions appear, with the Danish reform of the ninth century A.D., in connection with the State and work. 83 It may be objected that tools, weapons, signs, and jewelry in fact occur everywhere, in a common sphere. But that is not the problem, any more than it is to seek an origin in each case. It is a question of assigning assem blages, in other words, of determining the *differential traits *according to which an element formally belongs to one assemblage rather than to another. It could also be said that architecture and cooking have an appar ent affinity with the State, whereas music and drugs have differential traits that place them on the side of the nomadic war machine. 84 *It is therefore a * *differential method that establishes the distinction between weapons and  tools, *from at least five points of view: the direction *(sens) * (projection-introception), the vector (speed-gravity), the model (free action-work), the expression (jewelry-signs), and the passional or desiring tonality (affect-feeling). Doubtless the State apparatus tends to bring uniformity to the regimes, by disciplining its armies, by making work a fundamental unit, in other words, by imposing its own traits. But it is not impossible for weapons and tools, if they are taken up by new assemblages of metamorphosis, to enter other relations of alliance. The man of war may at times form peasant or worker alliances, but it is more frequent for a worker, industrial or agricultural, to reinvent a war machine. Peasants made an important con

A worker-soldier, weapon-tool, sentiment-affect affinity marks the right time, however fleeting, for revolutions and popular wars. There is a schizo phrenic taste for the tool that moves it away from work and toward free action, a schizophrenic taste for the weapon that turns it into a means for peace, for obtaining peace. A counterattack and a resistance simultane ously. Everything is ambiguous. But we do not believe that Ernst Junger's analyses are disqualified by this ambiguity when he portrays the "Rebel" as a transhistorical figure drawing the Worker, on the one hand, and the Sol dier, on the other, down a shared line of flight where one says simultane ously "I seek a weapon" and "I am looking for a tool": Draw the line, or what amounts to the same thing, cross the line, pass over the line, for the line is only drawn by surpassing the line of separation. 85 Undoubtedly, nothing is more outmoded than the man of war: he has long since been transformed into an entirely different character, the military man. And the worker himself has undergone so many misadventures . . . And yet men of war reappear, with many ambiguities: they are all those who know the use-lessness of violence but who are adjacent to a war machine to be recreated, one of active, revolutionary counterattacks. Workers also reappear who do not believe in work but who are adjacent to a work machine to be recreated, one of active resistance and technological liberation. They do not resuscitate old myths or archaic figures; they are the new figures of a transhistorical assemblage (neither historical nor eternal, but untimely): the nomad warrior and the ambulant worker. A somber caricature already precedes them, the mercenary or mobile military adviser, and the technocrat or transhumant analyst, CIA and IBM. But transhistorical figures must defend themselves as much against old myths as against preestablished, anticipatory disfigurations. "One does not go back to reconquer the myth, one encounters it anew, when time quakes at its foundations under the empire of extreme danger." Martial arts and state-of-the-art technologies have value only because they create the possibility of bringing together worker and warrior masses of a new type. The shared line of flight of the weapon and the tool: a pure possibility, a mutation. There arise subterranean, aerial, submarine technicians who belong more or less to the world order, but who involuntarily invent and amass virtual charges of knowledge and action that are usable by others, minute but easily acquired for new assemblages. The borrowings between warfare and the military apparatus, work and free action, always run in both directions, for a struggle that is all the more varied.

404 □ 1227: TREATISE ON NOMADOLOGY—THE WAR MACHINE P ROPOSITION VIII. *Metallurgy in itself constitutes a flow necessarily confluent * *with nomadism.* The political, economic, and social regime of the peoples of the steppe are less well known than their innovations in war, in the areas of offensive and defensive weapons, composition or strategy, and technological ele ments (the saddle, stirrup, horseshoe, harness, etc.). History contests each innovation but cannot succeed in effacing the nomad traces. What the nomads invented was the man-animal-weapon, man-horse-bow assem blage. Through this assemblage of speed, the ages of metal are marked by innovation. The socketed bronze battle-ax of the Hyksos and the iron sword of the Hittites have been compared to miniature atomic bombs. It has been possible to establish a rather precise periodization of the weapons of the steppe, showing the alternation between heavy and light armament (the Scythian type and the Sarmatian type), and their mixed forms. The cast steel saber, often short and curved, a weapon for side attack with the edge of the blade, envelops a different dynamic space than the forged iron sword used for frontal attack with the point: it was the Scythians who brought it to India and Persia, where the Arabs would later acquire it. It is commonly agreed that the nomads lost their role as innovators with the advent of firearms, in particular the cannon ("gunpowder overtook them"). But it was not necessarily because they did not know how to use them. Not only did armies like the Turkish army, whose nomadic tradi tions remained strong, develop extensive firepower, a new space, but addi tionally, and even more characteristically, light artillery was thoroughly integrated into mobile formations of wagons, pirate ships, etc. If the can non marks a limit for the nomads, it is on the contrary because it implies an economic investment that only a State apparatus can make (even commer cial cities do not suffice). The fact remains that for weapons other than fire arms, and even for the cannon, there is always a nomad on the horizon of a given *technological lineage** *6* Obviously, each case is controversial, as demonstrated by the debates on the stirrup. 87 The problem is that it is generally difficult to distinguish between what comes from the nomads as such, and what they receive from the empire they communicate with, conquer, or integrate with. There are so many gray areas, intermediaries, and combinations between an imper ial army and a nomad war machine that it is often the case that things origi nate in the empire. The example of the saber is typical, and unlike the stirrup, there is no longer any doubt. Although it is true that the Scythians were the propagators of the saber, introducing it to the Hindus, Persians, and Arabs, they were also its first victims, they started off on the receiving end; it was invented by the Chinese empire of the Ch'in and Han dynasties,

Even archaeologists are not immune from a certain hatred or contempt for the nomads. In the case of the saber, where the facts already speak sufficiently in favor of an imperial origin, the best of the commenta tors finds it fitting to add that the Scythians could not have invented it at any rate—poor nomads that they were—and that crucible steel necessarily came from a sedentary milieu. But why follow the very old, official Chinese version according to which deserters from the imperial army revealed the secrets to the Scythians? And what can "revealing the secret" mean if the Scythians were incapable of putting it to use, and understood nothing of all that? Blame the deserters, why don't you. You don't make an atomic bomb with a secret, any more than you make a saber if you are incapable of repro ducing it, and of integrating it under different conditions, of transferring it to other assemblages. Propagation and diffusion are fully a part of the line of innovation; they mark a bend in it. On top of that, why say that crucible steel is necessarily the property of sedentaries or imperial subjects, when it is first of all the invention of metallurgists? It is assumed that these metal lurgists were necessarily controlled by a State apparatus; but they also had to enjoy a certain technological autonomy, and social clandestinity, so that, even controlled, they did not belong to the State any more than they were themselves nomads. There were no deserters who betrayed the secret, but rather metallurgists who communicated it and made its adaptation and propagation possible: an entirely different kind of "betrayal." In the last analysis, what makes the discussions so difficult (both in the controversial case of the stirrup and in the definite case of the saber) are not only the prej udices about the nomads but also the absence of a sufficiently elaborated concept of the technological lineage (what defines a *technological line or  continuum, *and its variable extension, from a given standpoint?). It would be useless to say that metallurgy is a science because it discovers constant laws, for example, the melting point of a metal at all times and in all places. For metallurgy is inseparable from several lines of variation: var iation between meteorites and indigenous metals; variation between ores and proportions of metal; variation between alloys, natural and artificial; variation between the operations performed upon a metal; variation between the qualities that make a given operation possible, or that result from a given operation (for example, twelve varieties of copper identified and inventoried at Sumer by place of origin and degree of refinement). 89 All of these variables can be grouped under two overall rubrics: *singulari-  ties or spatiotemporal haecceities *of different orders, and the operations associated with them as processes of deformation or transformation;  *affective qualities or traits ofexpression *of different levels, corresponding to

0 406 □ 1227: TREATISE ON NOMADOLOGY—THE WAR MACHINE these singularities and operations (hardness, weight, color, etc.). Let us return to the example of the saber, or rather of crucible steel. It implies the actualization of a first singularity, namely, the melting of the iron at high temperature; then a second singularity, the successive decarbonations; cor responding to these singularities are traits of expression—not only the hardness, sharpness, and finish, but also the undulations or designs traced by the crystallization and resulting from the internal structure of the cast steel. The iron sword is associated with entirely different singularities because it is forged and not cast or molded, quenched and not air cooled, produced by the piece and not in number; its traits of expression are neces sarily very different because it pierces rather than hews, attacks from the front rather than from the side; even the expressive designs are obtained in an entirely different way, by inlay. 90 We may speak of a *machinic phylum, *or technological lineage, wherever we find *a constellation of singularities,  prolongable by certain operations, which converge, and make the operations  converge, upon one or several assignable traits of expression. *If the singulari ties or operations diverge, in different materials or in the same material, we must distinguish two different phyla: this is precisely the case for the iron sword, descended from the dagger, and the steel saber, descended from the knife. Each phylum has its own singularities and operations, its own quali ties and traits, which determine the relation of desire to the technical ele ment (the affects the saber "has" are not the same as those of the sword). But it is always possible to situate the analysis on the level of singularities that are prolongable from one phylum to another, and to tie the two phyla together. At the limit, there is a single phylogenetic lineage, a single machinic phylum, ideally continuous: the flow of matter-movement, the flow of matter in continuous variation, conveying singularities and traits of expression. This operative and expressive flow is as much artificial as natural: it is like the unity of human beings and Nature. But at the same time, it is not realized in the here and now without dividing, differentiat ing. We will call an *assemblage *every constellation of singularities and traits deducted from the flow—selected, organized, stratified—in such a way as to converge (consistency) artificially and naturally; an assemblage, in this sense, is a veritable invention. Assemblages may group themselves into extremely vast constellations constituting "cultures," or even "ages"; within these constellations, the assemblages still differentiate the phyla or the flow, dividing it into so many different phylas, of a given order, on a given level, and introducing selective discontinuities in the ideal continu ity of matter-movement. The assemblages cut the phylum up into distinct, differentiated lineages, at the same time as the machinic phylum cuts across them all, taking leave of one to pick up again in another, or making them coexist.

We may distin guish in every case a number of very different lines. Some of them, phylogenetic lines, travel long distances between assemblages of various ages and cultures (from the blowgun to the cannon? from the prayer wheel to the propeller? from the pot to the motor?); others, ontogenetic lines, are internal to one assemblage and link up its various elements or else cause one element to pass, often after a delay, into another assemblage of a differ ent nature but of the same culture or age (for example, the horseshoe, which spread through agricultural assemblages). It is thus necessary to take into account the selective action of the assemblages upon the phylum, and the evolutionary reaction of the phylum as the subterranean thread that passes from one assemblage to another, or quits an assemblage, draws it forward and opens it up. *Vital impulse! *Leroi-Gourhan has gone the farthest toward a technological vitalism taking biological evolution in general as the model for technical evolution: a *Universal Tendency, *laden with all of the singularities and traits of expression, traverses technical and interior milieus that refract or differentiate it in accordance with the singularities and traits each of them retains, selects, draws together, causes to converge, invents. 91 There is indeed a machinic phylum in variation that creates the technical assemblages, whereas the assemblages invent the various phyla. A technological lineage changes significantly according to whether one draws it upon the phylum or inscribes it in the assemblages; but the two are inseparable. So how are we to define this matter-movement, this matter-energy, this matter-flow, this matter in variation that enters assemblages and leaves them? It is a destratified, deterritorialized matter. It seems to us that Husserl brought thought a decisive step forward when he discovered a region of *vague and material *essences (in other words, essences that are vagabond, anexact and yet rigorous), distinguishing them from fixed, metric and formal, essences. We have seen that these vague essences are as distinct from formed things as they are from formal essences. They con stitute fuzzy aggregates. They relate to a *corporeality *(materiality) that is not to be confused either with an intelligible, formal essentiality or a sen sible, formed and perceived, thinghood. This corporeality has two char acteristics: on the one hand, it is inseparable from passages to the limit as changes of state, from processes of deformation or transformation that oper ate in a space-time itself anexact and that act in the manner of events (ablation, adjunction, projection . . .); on the other hand, it is inseparable from expressive or intensive qualities, which can be higher or lower in degree, and are produced in the manner of variable affects (resistance,

Doubtless Husserl had a tendency to make the vague essence a kind of intermediary between the essence and the sensible, between the thing and the concept, a little like the Kantian schema. Is not roundness a schematic or vague essence, intermediary between rounded sensible things and the conceptual essence of the circle? In effect, roundness exists only as a threshold-affect (neither flat nor pointed) and as a limit-process (becoming rounded), through sensible things and technical agents, millstone, lathe, wheel, spinning wheel socket, etc. But it is only "intermediary" to the extent that what is intermediary is autonomous, initially stretching *itself *between things, and between thoughts, to establish a whole new relation between thoughts and things, a  *vague *identity between the two. Certain distinctions proposed by Simondon can be compared to those of Husserl. For Simondon exposes the technological insufficiency of the matter-form model, in that it assumes a fixed form and a matter deemed homogeneous. It is the idea of the law that assures the model's coherence, since laws are what submit matter to this or that form, and conversely, realize in matter a given property deduced from the form. But Simondon demonstrates that the *hylomorphic *model leaves many things, active and affective, by the wayside. On the one hand, to the formed or formable mat ter we must add an entire energetic materiality in movement, carrying *sin-  gularities *or *haecceities *that are already like implicit forms that are topological, rather than geometrical, and that combine with processes of deformation: for example, the variable undulations and torsions of the fibers guiding the operation of splitting wood. On the other hand, to the essential properties of the matter deriving from the formal essence we must add *variable intensive affects, *now resulting from the operation, now on the contrary making it possible: for example, wood that is more or less porous, more or less elastic and resistant. At any rate, it is a question of surrender ing to the wood, then following where it leads by connecting operations to a materiality, instead of imposing a form upon a matter: what one addresses is less a matter submitted to laws than a materiality possessing a *nomos. * One addresses less a form capable of imposing properties upon a matter than material traits of expression constituting affects. Of course, it is always possible to " translate" into a model that which escapes the model; thus, one may link the materiality's power of variation to laws adapting a fixed form and a constant matter to one another. But this cannot be done without a distortion that consists in uprooting variables form the state of continuous variation, in order to extract from them fixed points and con

Thus one throws the variables off, even changing the nature of the equations, which cease to be immanent to matter-movement (inequations, adequations). The question is not whether such a translation is conceptually legitimate—it is—but what intuition gets lost in it. In short, what Simondon criticizes the hylomorphic model for is taking form and matter to be two terms defined separately, like the ends of two half-chains whose connection can no longer be seen, like a simple relation of molding behind which there is a perpetually variable, continuous modulation that it is no longer possible to grasp. 92 The critique of the hylomorphic schema is based on "the existence, between form and matter, of a zone of medium and intermediary dimension," of energetic, molecular dimension—a space unto itself that deploys its materiality through matter, a number unto itself that propels its traits through form. We always get back to this definition: the *machinic phylum *is ma teriality, natural or artificial, and both simultaneously; it is matter in movement, in flux, in variation, matter as a conveyor of singularities and traits of expression. This has obvious consequences: namely, this matter-flow can only *he followed. *Doubtless, the operation that consists in following can be carried out in one place: an artisan who planes follows the wood, the fibers of the wood, without changing location. But this way of following is only one particular sequence in a more general process. For artisans are obliged to follow in another way as well, in other words, to go find the wood where it lies, and to find the wood with the right kind of fibers. Otherwise, they must have it brought to them: it is only because merchants take care of one segment of the journey in reverse that the artisans can avoid making the trip themselves. But artisans are complete only if they are also prospectors; and the organization that separates prospectors, merchants, and artisans already mutilates artisans in order to make "workers" of them. We will therefore define the artisan as one who is determined in such a way as to follow a flow of matter, a *machinic  phylum. *The artisan is *the itinerant, the ambulant. *To follow the flow of matter is to itinerate, to ambulate. It is intuition in action. Of course, there are second-order itinerancies where it is no longer a flow of matter that one prospects and follows, but, for example, a market. Nevertheless, it is always a flow that is followed, even if the flow is not always that of matter. And, above all, there are secondary itinerancies, which derive from another "condition," even if they are necessarily entailed by it. For example, a *transhumant, *whether a farmer or an animal raiser, changes land after it is worn out, or else seasonally; but transhumants only secondarily follow a land flow, because they undertake a rotation meant from the start to return them to the point from which they left, after the forest has regenerated, the land has rested, the weather has changed. Transhumants do not follow a flow, they draw a circuit; they only

Transhumants are therefore itinerant only consequentially, or become itinerant only when their circuit of land or pasture has been exhausted, or when the rotation has become so wide that the flows escape the circuit. Even the merchant is a transhumant, to the extent that mercan tile flows are subordinated to the rotation between a point of departure and a point of arrival (go get-bring back, import-export, buy-sell). Whatever the reciprocal implications, there are considerable differences between a flow and a circuit. The *migrant, *we have seen, is something else again. And the *nomad *is not primarily defined as an *itinerant *or as a *transhumant, *nor as a *migrant, *even though nomads become these consequentially. The pri mary determination of nomads is to occupy and hold a smooth space: it is this aspect that determines them as nomad (essence). On their own account, they will be transhumants, or itinerants, only by virtue of the imperatives imposed by the smooth spaces. In short, whatever the de facto mixes between nomadism, itinerancy, and transhumance, the primary concept is different in the three cases (smooth space, matter-flow, rota tion). It is only on the basis of the distinct concept that we can make a judg ment on the mix—on when it is produced, on the form in which it is produced, and on the order in which it is produced. But in the course of the preceding discussion, we have wandered from the question: Why is the *machinic phylum, *the flow of matter, essentially metallic or metallurgical? Here again, it is only the distinct concept that can give us an answer, in that it shows that there is a special, primary rela tion between itinerance and metallurgy (deterritorialization). However, the examples we took from Husserl and Simondon concerned wood and clay as well as metals. Besides, are there not flows of grass, water, herds, which form so many phyla or matters in movement? It is easier for us to answer these questions now. For it is as if metal and metallurgy imposed upon and raised to consciousness something that is only hidden or buried in the other matters and operations. The difference is that elsewhere the operations occur between two thresholds, one of which constitutes the matter prepared for the operation, and the other the form to be incarnated (for example, the clay and the mold). The hylomorphic model derives its general value from this, since the incarnated form that marks the end of an operation can serve as the matter for a new operation, but in a fixed order marking a succession of thresholds. In metallurgy, on the other hand, the operations are always astride the thresholds, so that an energetic materiality overspills the prepared matter, and a qualitative deformation or transformation overspills the form. 93 For example, quenching follows forging and takes place after the form has been fixed. Or, to take another example, in molding, the metallurgist in a sense works inside the mold. Or

Finally, metallurgy has the option of melting down and reusing a matter to which it gives an *ingot-form: *the history of metal is inseparable from this very particular form, which is not to be confused with either a stock or a commodity; monetary value derives from it. More generally, the metallurgical idea of the "reducer" expresses this double lib eration of a materiality in relation to a prepared matter, and of a transfor mation in relation to the form to be incarnated. Matter and form have never seemed more rigid than in metallurgy; yet the succession of forms tends to be replaced by the form of a continuous development, and the var iability of matters tends to be replaced by the matter of a continuous varia tion. If metallurgy has an essential relation with music, it is by virtue not only of the sounds of the forge but also of the tendency within both arts to bring into its own, beyond separate forms, a continuous development of form, and beyond variable matters, a continuous variation of matter: a widened chromaticism sustains both music and metallurgy; the musical smith was the first "transformer." 94 In short, what metal and metallurgy bring to light is a life proper to matter, a vital state of matter as such, a mate rial vitalism that doubtless exists everywhere but is ordinarily hidden or covered, rendered unrecognizable, dissociated by the hylomorphic model. Metallurgy is the consciousness or thought of the matter-flow, and metal the correlate of this consciousness. As expressed in panmetallism, metal is coextensive to the whole of matter, and the whole of matter to metallurgy. Even the waters, the grasses and varieties of wood, the animals are popu lated by salts or mineral elements. Not everything is metal, but metal is everywhere. Metal is the conductor of all matter. The machinic phylum is metallurgical, or at least has a metallic head, as its itinerant probe-head or guidance device. And thought is born more from metal than from stone: metallurgy is minor science in person, "vague" science or the phenom enology of matter. The prodigious idea *of Nonorganic Life*—the very same idea Worringer considered the barbarian idea par excellence 95 —was the invention, the intuition of metallurgy. Metal is neither a thing nor an organism, but a *body *without organs. The "Northern, or Gothic, line" is above all a mining or metallic line delimiting this body. The relation between metallurgy and alchemy reposes not, as Jung believed, on the sym bolic value of metal and its correspondence with an organic soul but on the immanent power of corporeality in all matter, and on the esprit de corps accompanying it. The first and primary itinerant is the artisan. But artisans are neither hunters, farmers, nor animal raisers. Neither are they winnowers or pot ters, who only secondarily take up craft activity. Rather, artisans are those who follow the matter-flow as pure productivity: therefore in mineral

Because metal is the pure productivity of matter, those who follow metal are producers of objects par excellence. As demon strated by V. Gordon Childe, the metallurgist is the first specialized arti san, and in this respect forms a collective *body *(secret societies, guilds, journeymen's associations). Artisans-metallurgists are itinerants because they follow the matter-flow of the subsoil. Of course metallurgists have relations with "the others," those of the soil, land, and sky. They have rela tions with the farmers of the sedentary communities, and with the celestial functionaries of the empire who overcode those communities; in fact, they need them to survive, they depend on an imperial agricultural stockpile for their very sustenance. 96 But in their work, they have relations with the forest dwellers, and partially depend on them: they must establish their workshops near the forest in order to obtain the necessary charcoal. In their space, they have relations with the nomads, since the subsoil unites the ground  *(sol) *of smooth space and the land of striated space: there are no mines in the alluvial valleys of the empire-dominated farmers; it is necessary to cross deserts, approach the mountains; and the question of control over the mines always involves nomadic peoples. *Every mine is a line of flight * that is in communication with smooth spaces—there are parallels today in the problems with oil. Archaeology and history remain strangely silent on this question of the control over the mines. There have been empires with a strong metallurgi cal organization that had no mines; the Near East lacked tin, so necessary for the fabrication of bronze. Large quantities of metal arrived in ingot form, and from very far away (for instance, tin from Spain or even from Cornwall). So complex a situation implies not only a strong imperial bureaucracy and elaborate long-distance commercial circuits; it also implies a shifting politics, in which States confront an outside, in which very different peoples confront one another, or else reach some accommo dation on particular aspects of the control of mines (extraction, charcoal, workshops, transportation). It is not enough to say that there are wars and mining expeditions; or to invoke "a Eurasian synthesis of the nomadic workshops from the approaches of China to the tip of Britanny," and remark that "the nomadic populations had been in contact with the princi pal metallurgical centers of the ancient world since prehistoric times." 97 What is needed is a better knowledge of the nomads' relations with these centers, with the smiths they themselves employed or frequented, with properly metallurgical peoples or groups who were their neighbors. What was the situation in the Caucasus and in the Altai? In Spain and North Africa? Mines are a source of flow, mixture, and escape with few equiva lents in history. Even when they are well controlled by an empire that owns

The study of myths, and even eth-  nographic considerations on the status of smiths, divert us from these  political questions. Mythology and ethnology do not have the right method  in this regard. It is too often asked how *the others *"react" to the smith, and  as a result, one succumbs to the usual platitudes about the ambivalence of  *feelings; *it is said that the smith is simultaneously honored, feared, and  scorned—more or less scorned among the nomads, more or less honored  among the sedentaries. 98 But this loses sight of the reasons for this situa tion, of the specificity of the smiths themselves, of the nonsymmetrical  relation they entertain with the nomads and the sedentaries, the type of  *affects *they invent (metallic affect). Before looking at the feelings of others  toward smiths, it is necessary to evaluate the smiths themselves as Other;  as such, they have different affective relations with the sedentaries and the  nomads. There are no nomadic or sedentary smiths. Smiths are ambulant, itiner ant. Particularly important in this respect is the way in which smiths live:  their space is neither the striated space of the sedentary nor the smooth  space of the nomad. Smiths may have a tent, they may have a house; they  inhabit them in the manner of an "ore bed" (gite, shelter, home, mineral  deposit), like metal itself, in the manner of a cave or a hole, a hut half or all  underground. They are cave dwellers not by nature but by artistry and  need." A splendid text by Elie Faure evokes the infernal progress of the  itinerant peoples of India as they bore holes in space and create the fantas-  tic forms corresponding to these breakthroughs, the vital forms of  nonorganic life: "There at the shore of the sea, at the base of a mountain,  they encountered a great wall of granite. Then they all entered the granite;  in its shadows they lived, loved, worked, died, were born, and, three or four  centuries afterward, they came out again, leagues away, having traversed  the mountain. Behind them they left the emptied rock, its galleries hol-  lowed out in every direction, its sculptured, chiseled walls, its natural or  artificial pillars turned into a deep lacework with ten thousand horrible or  charming figures.. . . Here man confesses unresistingly his strength and his  nothingness. He does not exact the affirmation of a determined ideal from  form.... He extracts it rough from formlessness, according to the dictates  of the formless. He utilizes the indentations and accidents of the rock." 100 Metallurgical India. Transpierce the mountains instead of scaling them,  excavate the land instead of striating it, bore holes in space instead of keep-  ing it smooth, turn the earth into swiss cheese.

It is in their specificity, it is by virtue of their itinerancy, by virtue of their inventing a holey space, that they necessarily communicate with the sedentaries *and *with the nomads (and with others besides, with the transhumant forest dwellers). They are in themselves double: a hybrid, an alloy, a twin formation. As Griaule says, Dogon smiths are not "impure" but "mixed," and it is because they are mixed that they are *endogamous, *that they do not intermarry with the pure, who have a simplified progeny while they reconstitute a twin prog eny. 102 Childe demonstrates that metallurgists are necessarily doubled, that they exist two times, once as captured by and maintained within the apparatus of the oriental empire, again in the Aegean world, where they were much more mobile and much freer. *But the two segments cannot be  separated, *simply by relating each of them to their particular context. The metallurgist belonging to an empire, the worker, presupposes a metallur gist-prospector, however far away; and the prospector ties in with a mer chant, who brings the metal to the first metallurgist. In addition, the metal is worked on by each segment, and the ingot-form is common to them all: we must imagine less separate segments than a chain of mobile workshops constituting, from hole to hole, a line of variation, a gallery. Thus the met allurgists' relation to the nomads and the sedentaries also passes through the relations they have with other metallurgists. 103 This hybrid metallur gist, a weapon- and toolmaker, communicates with the sedentaries *and * with the nomads at the same time. Holey space itself communicates with smooth space and striated space. In effect, the machinic phylum or the metallic line passes through all of the assemblages: nothing is more deterritorialized than matter-movement. But it is not at all in the same way, and the two communications are not symmetrical. Worringer, in the domain of aesthetics, said that the abstract line took on two quite different expressions, one in barbarian Gothic art, the other in the organic classical art. Here, we would say that the phylum simultaneously has two different modes of liaison: it is always *connected *to nomad space, whereas it *conju-  gates *with sedentary space. On the side of the nomadic assemblages and war machines, it is a kind of rhizome, with its gaps, detours, subterranean passages, stems, openings, traits, holes, etc. On the other side, the seden tary assemblages and State apparatuses effect a capture of the phylum, put the traits of expression into a form or a code, make the holes resonate together, plug the lines of flight, subordinate the technological operation to the work model, impose upon the connections a whole regime of arbor escent conjunctions.

First, is the battle the "object" of war? But also, is war the "object" of the war machine? And finally, to what extent is the war machine the "object" of the State appara tus? The ambiguity of the first two problems is certainly due to the term "object," but implies their dependency on the third. We must nevertheless approach these problems gradually, even if we are reduced to multiplying examples. The first question, that of the battle, requires an immediate dis tinction to be made between two cases: when a battle is sought, and when it is essentially avoided by the war machine. These two cases in no way coin cide with the offensive and the defensive. But war in the strict sense (according to a conception of it that culminated in Foch) does seem to have the battle as its object, whereas guerrilla warfare explicitly aims for the  *nonbattle. *However, the development of war into the war of movement, and into total war, also places the notion of the battle in question, as much from the offensive as the defensive points of view: the concept of the nonbattle seems capable of expressing the speed of a flash attack, and the counterspeed of an immediate response. 104 Conversely, the development of guerilla warfare implies a moment when, and forms under which, a bat tle must be effectively sought, in connection with exterior and interior "support points." And it is true that guerrilla warfare and war proper are constantly borrowing each other's methods and that the borrowings run equally in both directions (for example, stress has often been laid on the inspirations land-based guerrilla warfare received from maritime war). All we can say is that the battle and the nonbattle are the double object of war, according to a criterion that does not coincide with the offensive and the defensive, or even with war proper and guerrilla warfare.

0 1227: TREATISE ON NOMADOLOGY—THE WAR MACHINE D 417 object of the war machine. It is not at all obvious. To the extent that war (with or without the battle) aims for the annihilation or capitulation of enemy forces, the war machine does not necessarily have war as its object (for example, the *raid can *be seen as another object, rather than as a partic ular form of war). But more generally, we have seen that the war machine was the invention of the nomad, because it is in its essence the constitutive element of smooth space, the occupation of this space, displacement within this space, and the corresponding composition of people: this is its sole and veritable positive object *(nomos). *Make the desert, the steppe, grow; do not depopulate it, quite the contrary. If war necessarily results, it is because the war machine collides with States and cities, as forces (of stri-ation) opposing its positive object: from then on, the war machine has as its enemy the State, the city, the state and urban phenomenon, and adopts as its objective their annihilation. It is at this point that the war machine becomes war: annihilate the forces of the State, destroy the State-form. The Attila, or Genghis Khan, adventure clearly illustrates this progression from the positive object to the negative object. Speaking like Aristotle, we would say that war is neither the condition nor the object of the war machine, but necessarily accompanies or completes it; speaking like Derrida, we would say that war is the "supplement" of the war machine. It may even happen that this supplementarity is comprehended through a progressive, anxiety-ridden revelation. Such, for example, was the adven ture of Moses: leaving the Egyptian State behind, launching into the desert, he begins by forming a war machine, on the inspiration of the old past of the nomadic Hebrews and on the advice of his father-in-law, who came from the nomads. This is the machine of the Just, already a war machine, but one that does not yet have war as its object. Moses realizes, little by lit tle, in stages, that war is the necessary supplement of that machine, because it encounters or must cross cities and States, because it must send ahead spies *(armed observation), *then perhaps take things to extremes *(war of  annihilation). *Then the Jewish people experience doubt, and fear that they are not strong enough; but Moses also doubts, he shrinks before the revela tion of this supplement. And it will be Joshua, not Moses, who is charged with waging war. Finally, speaking like Kant, we would say that the relation between war and the war machine is necessary but "synthetic" (Yahweh is necessary for the synthesis). The question of war, in turn, is pushed further back and is subordinated to the relations between the war machine and the State apparatus. States were not the first to make war: war, of course, is not a phenomenon one finds in the universality of Nature, as nonspecific violence. But war is not the object of States, quite the contrary. The most archaic States do not even seem to have had a war machine, and their domination, as we will see, was

0 418 □1227: TREATISE ON NOMADOLOGY—THE WAR MACHINE based on other agencies (comprising, rather, the police and prisons). It is safe to assume that the intervention of an extrinsic or nomad war machine that counterattacked and destroyed the archaic but powerful States was one of the mysterious reasons for their sudden annihilation. But the State learns fast. One of the biggest questions from the point of view of universal history is: How will the State *appropriate *the war machine, that is, consti tute one for itself, in conformity with its size, its domination, and its aims? And with what risks? (What we call a military institution, or army, is not at all the war machine in itself, but the form under which it is appropriated by the State.) In order to grasp the paradoxical character of such an undertak ing, we must recapitulate the hypothesis in its entirety. (1) The war machine is that nomad invention that in fact has war not as its primary object but as its second-order, supplementary or synthetic objective, in the sense that it is determined in such a way as to destroy the State-form and city-form with which it collides. (2) When the State appropriates the war machine, the latter obviously changes in nature and function, since it is afterward directed against the nomad and all State destroyers, or else expresses relations between States, to the extent that a State undertakes exclusively to destroy another State or impose its aims upon it. (3) It is pre cisely after the war machine has been appropriated by the State in this way that it tends to take war for its direct and primary object, for its "analytic" object (and that war tends to take the battle for its object). In short, it is at one and the same time that the State apparatus appropriates a war machine, that the war machine takes war as its object, and that war be comes subordinated to the aims of the State. This question of appropriation is so varied historically that it is neces sary to distinguish between several kinds of problems. The first concerns the possibility of the operation: it is precisely because war is only the sup plementary or synthetic object of the nomad war machine that it experi ences the hesitation that proves fatal to it, and that the State apparatus for its part is able to lay hold of war and thus turn the war machine back against the nomads. The hesitation of the nomad is legendary: What is to be done with the lands conquered and crossed? Return them to the desert, to the steppe, to open pastureland? Or let a State apparatus survive that is capa ble of exploiting them directly, at the risk of becoming, sooner or later, sim ply a new dynasty of that apparatus: sooner or later because Genghis Khan and his followers were able to hold out for a long time by partially integrat ing themselves into the conquered empires, while at the same time main taining a smooth space on the steppes to which the imperial centers were subordinated. That was their genius, the *Pax Mongolica. *It remains the case that the integration of the nomads into the conquered empires was one of the most powerful factors of appropriation of the war machine by the

0 1227: TREATISE ON NOMADOLOGY—THE WAR MACHINE □ 419 State apparatus: the inevitable danger to which the nomads succumbed. But there is another danger as well, the one threatening the State when it appropriates the war machine (all States have felt the weight of this danger, as well as the risks this appropriation represents for them). Tamerlane is the extreme example. He was not Genghis Khan's successor but his exact opposite: it was Tamerlane who constructed a fantastic war machine turned back against the nomads, but who, by that very fact, was obliged to erect a State apparatus all the heavier and more unproductive since it existed only as the empty form of appropriation of that machine. 105 Turn ing the war machine back against the nomads may constitute for the State a danger as great as that presented by nomads directing the war machine against States. A second type of problem concerns the concrete forms the appropria tion of the war machine takes: Mercenary or territorial? A professional army or a conscripted army? A special body or national recruiting? Not only are these formulas not equivalent, but there are all the possible mixes between them. Perhaps the most relevant distinction to make, or the most general one, would be: Is there merely "encastment" of the war machine, or "appropriation" proper? The capture of the war machine by the State apparatus took place following two paths, by encasting a society of warri ors (who arrived from without or arose from within), or on the contrary by constituting it in accordance with rules corresponding to civil society as a whole. Once again, there is passage and transition from one formula to another. Last, the third type of problem concerns the means of appro priation. We must consider from this standpoint the various data pertain ing to the fundamental aspects of the State apparatus: *territoriality, work  or public works, taxation. *The constitution of a military institution or an army necessarily implies a territorialization of the war machine, in other words, the granting of land ("colonial" or domestic), which can take very diverse forms. But at the same time, fiscal regimes determine both the nature of the services and taxes owed by the beneficiary warriors, and especially the kind of civil tax to which all or part of society is subject for the maintenance of the army. And the State enterprise of public works must be reorganized along the lines of a "laying out of the territory" in which the army plays a determining role, not only in the case of fortresses and fortified cities, but also in strategic communication, the logistical structure, the industrial infrastructure, etc. (the role and function of the Engineer in this form of appropriation). 106 Let us compare this hypothesis as a whole with Clausewitz's formula: "War is the continuation of politics by other means." As we know, this for mula is itself extracted from a theoretical and practical, historic and transhistoric, aggregate whose parts are interconnected. (1) There is a pure

0 420 □ 1227: TREATISE ON NOMADOLOGY—THE WAR MACHINE concept of war as absolute, unconditioned war, an Idea not given in experi ence (bring down or "upset" the enemy, who is assumed to have no other determination, with no political, economic, or social considerations entering in). (2) What is given are real wars as submitted to State aims; States are better or worse "conductors" in relation to absolute war, and in any case condition its realization in experience. (3) Real wars swing between two poles, both subject to State politics: the war of annihilation, which can escalate to total war (depending on the objectives of the annihi lation) and tends to approach the unconditioned concept via an ascent to extremes; and limited war, which is no "less" a war, but one that effects a descent toward limiting conditions, and can de-escalate to mere "armed observation." 107 In the first place, the distinction between absolute war as Idea and real wars seems to us to be of great importance, but only if a different criterion than that of Clausewitz is applied. The pure Idea is not that of the abstract elimination of the adversary but that of a war machine *that does not have  war as its object *and that only entertains a potential or supplementary syn thetic relation with war. Thus the nomad war machine does not appear to us to be one case of real war among others, as in Clausewitz, but on the con trary the content adequate to the Idea, the invention of the Idea, with its own objects, space, and composition of the *nomos. *Nevertheless it is still an Idea, and it is necessary to retain the concept of the pure Idea, even though this war machine was realized by the nomads. It is the nomads, rather, who remain an abstraction, an Idea, something real and nonactual, and for several reasons: first, because the elements of nomadism, as we have seen, enter into de facto mixes with elements of migration, itinerancy, and transhumance; this does not affect the purity of the concept, but intro duces always mixed objects, or combinations of space and composition, which react back upon the war machine from the beginning. Second, even in the purity of its concept, the nomad war machine necessarily effectuates its synthetic relation with war as supplement, uncovered and developed in opposition to the State-form, the destruction of which is at issue. But that is exactly it; it does not effectuate this supplementary object or this synthetic relation without the State, for its part, finding the opportunity to appropri ate the war machine, and the means of making war the direct object of this turned-around machine (thus the integration of the nomad into the State is a vector traversing nomadism from the very beginning, from the first act of war against the State). The question is therefore less the realization of war than the appropria tion of the war machine. It is at the same time that the State apparatus  *appropriates *the war machine, subordinates it to its "political" *aims, *and gives it war as its direct *object. *And it is one and the same historical ten

The factors that make State war total war are closely connected to capitalism: it has to do with the investment of constant capital in equip ment, industry, and the war economy, and the investment of variable capi tal in the population in its physical and mental aspects (both as warmaker and as victim of war). 108 Total war is not only a war of annihilation but arises when annihilation takes as its "center" not only the enemy army, or the enemy State, but the entire population and its economy. The fact that this double investment can be made only under prior conditions of limited war illustrates the irresistible character of the capitalist tendency to develop total war.' 09 It is therefore true that total war remains subordinated to State political aims and merely realizes the *maximal conditions *of the appropriation of the war machine by the State apparatus. But it is also true that when total war becomes the object of the appropriated war machine, then at this level in the set of all possible conditions, the object and the aim enter into new relations that can reach the point of contradiction. This explains Clausewitz's vacillation when he asserts at one point that total war remains a war conditioned by the political aim of States, and at another that it tends to effectuate the Idea of unconditioned war. In effect, the aim remains essentially political and determined as such by the State, but the object itself has become unlimited. We could say that the appropriation has changed direction, or rather that States tend to unleash, reconstitute, an immense war machine of which they are no longer anything more than the opposable or apposed parts. This worldwide war machine, which in a way "reissues" from the States, displays two successive figures: first, that of fascism, which makes war an unlimited movement with no other aim than itself; but fascism is only a rough sketch, and the second, postfascist, figure is that of a war machine that takes peace as its obj ect directly, as the peace of Terror or Survival. The war machine reforms a smooth space that now claims to control, to surround the entire earth. Total war itself is surpassed, toward a form of peace more terrifying still. The war machine has taken charge of the aim, worldwide order, and the States are now no more than objects or means adapted to that machine. This is the point at which Clausewitz's formula is effectively reversed; to be entitled to say that poli tics is the continuation of war by other means, it is not enough to invert the order of the words as if they could be spoken in either direction; it is neces sary to follow the real movement at the conclusion of which the States, hav ing appropriated a war machine, and having adapted it to their aims, reimpart a war machine that takes charge of the aim, appropriates the States, and assumes increasingly wider political functions. 110

0 422 □ 1227: TREATISE ON NOMADOLOGY—THE WAR MACHINE Doubtless, the present situation is highly discouraging. We have watched the war machine grow stronger and stronger, as in a science fiction story; we have seen it assign as its objective a peace still more terrifying than fascist death; we have seen it maintain or instigate the most terrible of local wars as parts of itself; we have seen it set its sights on a new type of enemy, no longer another State, or even another regime, but the "unspeci fied enemy"; we have seen it put its counterguerrilla elements into place, so that it can be caught by surprise once, but not twice. Yet the very conditions that make the State or World war machine possible, in other words, con stant capital (resources and equipment) and human variable capital, continually recreate unexpected possibilities for counterattack, unfore seen initiatives determining revolutionary, popular, minority, mutant machines. The definition of the Unspecified Enemy testifies to this: "mul tiform, maneuvering and omnipresent... of the moral, political, subversive or economic order, etc.," the unassignable material Saboteur or human Deserter assuming the most diverse forms."' The first theoretical element of importance is the fact that the war machine has many varied meanings, and this is *precisely because the war machine has an extremely variable  relation to war itself. *The war machine is not uniformly defined, and comprises something other than increasing quantities of force. We have tried to define two poles of the war machine: *at one pole, *it takes war for its object and forms a line of destruction prolongable to the limits of the universe. But in all of the shapes it assumes here—limited war, total war, worldwide organization—war represents not at all the supposed essence of the war machine but only, whatever the machine's power, either the set of conditions under which the States appropriate the machine, even going so far as to project it as the horizon of the world, or the dominant order of which the States themselves are now only parts. *The other pole *seemed to be the essence; it is when the war machine, with infinitely lower "quantities," has as its object not war but the drawing of a creative line of flight, the com position of a smooth space and of the movement of people in that space. At this other pole, the machine does indeed encounter war, but as its supple mentary or synthetic object, now directed against the State and against the worldwide axiomatic expressed by States. We thought it possible to assign the invention of the war machine to the nomads. This was done only in the historical interest of demonstrating that the war machine as such was invented, even if it displayed from the begin ning all of the ambiguity that caused it to enter into composition with the other pole, and swing toward it from the start. However, in conformity with the essence, the nomads do not hold the secret: an "ideological," scientific, or artistic movement can be a potential war machine, to the precise extent to which it draws, in relation to *aphylum, *a plane of consistency, a creative

0 1227: TREATISE ON NOMADOLOGY—THE WAR MACHINE □ 423 line of flight, a smooth space of displacement. It is not the nomad who defines this constellation of characteristics; it is this constellation that defines the nomad, and at the same time the essence of the war machine. If guerrilla warfare, minority warfare, revolutionary and popular war are in conformity with the essence, it is because they take war as an object all the more necessary for being merely "supplementary": *they can make war only  on the condition that they simultaneously create something else, *if only new nonorganic social relations. The difference between the two poles is great, even, and especially, from the point of view of death: the line of flight that creates, *or *turns into a line of destruction; the plane of consistency that constitutes itself, even piece by piece, *or *turns into a plan(e) of organiza tion and domination. We are constantly reminded that there is communi cation between these two lines or planes, that each takes nourishment from the other, borrows from the other: the worst of the world war machines reconstitutes a smooth space to surround and enclose the earth. But the earth asserts its own powers of deterritorialization, its lines of flight, its smooth spaces that live and blaze their way for a new earth. The question is not one of quantities but of the incommensurable character of the quanti ties that confront one another in the two kinds of war machine, according to the two poles. War machines take shape against the apparatuses that appropriate the machine and make war their affair and their object: they bring connections to bear against the great conjunction of the apparatuses of capture or domination.

The State apparatus is thus animated by a curious  rhythm, which is first of all a great mystery: that of the Binder-Gods or  magic emperors, *One-Eyed men *emitting from their single eye signs that  capture, tie knots at a distance. The jurist-kings, on the other hand, are  *One-Armed *men who raise their single arm as an element of right and  technology, the law and the tool.

0 7000 B.C.: APPARATUS OF CAPTURE □ 425 Pompidou?). This is not to say that one has exclusive right to signs, the other to tools. The fearsome emperor is already the master of large-scale works; the wise king takes up and transforms the entire regime of signs. What it means is that the combination, signs-tools, constitutes the differ ential trait of political sovereignty, or the complementarity of the State. 2 2\. Of course, the two men of State are always getting mixed up in affairs of war. But either the magic emperor sends to battle warriors who are not his own, whom he takes into his service by capture; or, more important, when he makes his appearance on the battlefield, he suspends the use of weapons, he throws his net over the warriors, his single eye throws them into petrified catatonia, "he binds without combat," he *encasts *the war machine (this State capture is not to be confused with the captures of war: conquests, prisoners, spoils). 3 As for the other pole, the jurist-king is a great organizer of war; but he gives it laws, lays out a field for it, makes it princi pled, imposes a discipline upon it, subordinates it to political ends. He turns the war machine into a military institution, he *appropriates *the war machine for the State apparatus. 4 We should not be too hasty in speaking of a softening, a humanization: on the contrary, this is perhaps when the war machine has only one remaining object, that of war itself. Violence is found everywhere, but under different regimes and economies. The violence of the magic emperor: his knot, his net, his way of "making his moves once and for all" ... The violence of the jurist-king: his way of beginning over again every move, always with attention to ends, alliances, and laws... All things considered, the violence of the war machine might appear softer and more supple than that of the State apparatus because it does not yet have war as its "object," because it eludes both poles of the State. That is why the man of war, in his exteriority, is always protesting the alliances and pacts of the jurist-king, as well as severing the bonds of the magic emperor. He is equally an unbinder and a betrayer: twice the traitor. 5 He has another econ omy, another cruelty, but also another justice, another pity. To the signs and tools of the State, the man of war opposes his weapons and jewelry. Once again, who could say which is better and which is worse? It is true that war kills, and hideously mutilates. But it is especially true after the State has appropriated the war machine. Above all, the State apparatus makes the mutilation, and even death, come first. It needs them preaccom-plished, for people to be born that way, crippled and zombielike. The myth of the zombie, of the living dead, is a work myth and not a war myth. Mutilation is a consequence of war, but it is a necessary condition, a presupposition of the State apparatus and the organization of work (hence the native infirmity not only of the worker but also of the man of State himself, whether of the One-Eyed or the One-Armed type): "The brutal exhibition of severed flesh shocked me....

Mankind has waged wars since the world began, but I can't remember one single example in the *Iliad *where the loss of an arm or a leg is reported. Mythology reserved mutilation for monsters, for human beasts of the race of Tantalus or Procrustes.... It is an optical illusion to attribute these mutilations to accidents. Actually, acci dents are the result of mutilations that took place long ago in the embryo of our world; and the increase in amputations is one of the symptoms bearing witness to the triumph of the morality of the scalpel. The loss occurred long before it was visibly taken into account." 6 The State apparatus needs, at its summit as at its base, predisabled people, preexisting amputees, the still born, the congenitally infirm, the one-eyed and one-armed. Thus there is a tempting three-part hypothesis: the war machine is "between" the two poles of political sovereignty and assures the passage from one pole to the other. It is indeed in that order, 1-2-3, that things seem to present themselves in myth and history. Take two versions of the One-Eyed and the One-Armed gods analyzed by Dumezil: (1) the god Odin, who has a single eye, ties up the wolf of war and holds him in his magic bond; (2) but the wolf is wary and has at its disposal all its power of exteriority; (3) the god Tyr gives the wolf a legal security by leaving one of his hands in the wolfs mouth so the wolf can bite it off if it does not succeed in extricating itself from the bond. (1) Horatius Codes, the One-Eyed, using only his face, his grimace and magic power, prevents the Etruscan commander from attacking Rome; (2) the war commander then decides to lay siege; (3) Mucius Scaevola takes a political tack, offering his hand as a security in order *to *persuade the warrior that it would be best to abandon the siege and conclude a pact. In an entirely different, historical, context, Marcel Detienne suggests an analogous schema in three moments for ancient Greece: (1) The magic sov ereign, the "Master of Truth," has at his disposal a war machine that doubt less does not originate with him, and which enjoys a relative autonomy within his empire; (2) this class of warriors has its own rules, defined by "isonomy," an isotropic space, and a "milieu" (war spoils are in the middle  *[au milieu], *he who speaks places himself in the middle of the assembly); this is another space, the rules are different from those of the sovereign, who captures and speaks from on high; (3) the hoplite reform, the ground work for which was laid in the warrior class, spread throughout the social body, promoting the formation of an army of citizen-soldiers; at the same time, the last vestiges of the imperial pole of sovereignty were replaced by the juridical pole of the city-state (with isonomy as its law, and isotropy as its space). 7 Thus in every case, the war machine seems to intervene "between" the two poles of the State apparatus, assuring and necessitating the passage from one to the other.

0 7000 B.C.: APPARATUS OF CAPTURE □ 427 We cannot, however, assign this schema a causal meaning (the authors cited do not do so). In the first place, the war machine explains nothing; for it is either exterior to the State, and directed against it; or else it already belongs to the State, encasted and appropriated, and presupposes it. If the war machine has a part in the evolution of the State, it is therefore necessar ily in conjunction with other internal factors. And this is the second point: if there is an evolution of the State, the second pole, the evolved pole, must be in resonance with the first, it must continually recharge it in some way, and the State must have only one milieu of interiority; in other words, it must have a *unity of composition, *in spite of all the differences in organiza tion and development among States. It is even necessary for each State to have both poles, as the essential moments of its existence, even though the organization of the two varies. Third, if we call this interior essence or this unity of the State "capture," we must say that the words "magic capture" describe the situation well because it always appears as preaccomplished and self-presupposing; but how is this capture to be explained then, if it leads back to no *distinct *assignable cause? That is why theses on the origin of the State are always tautological. At times, exogenous factors, tied to war and the war machine, are invoked; at times endogenous factors, thought to engender private property, money, etc.; and at times specific factors, thought to determine the formation of "public functions." All three of these theses are found in Engels, in relation to a conception of the diversity of the roads to Domination. But they beg the question. War produces the State only if at least one of the two parts is a preexistent State; and the organization of war is a State factor only if that organization is a part of the State. Either the State has no war machine (and has policemen and jailers before having soldiers), or else it has one, but in the form of a military insti tution or public function. 8 Similarly, private property presupposes State public property, it slips through its net; and money presupposes taxation. It is even more difficult to see how public functions could have existed before the State they imply. We are always brought back to the idea of a State that comes into the world fully formed and rises up in a single stroke, the uncon ditioned *Urstaat.* P ROPOSITION XI. *Which comes first?* We shall call the first pole of capture imperial or despotic. It corresponds to Marx's Asiatic formation. Archaeology discovers it everywhere, often lost in oblivion, at the horizon of all systems or States—not only in Asia, but also in Africa, America, Greece, Rome. Immemorial *Urstaat, *dating as far back as Neolithic times, and perhaps farther still.

This is the *paradigm *of the bond, the knot. Such is the regime of signs of the State: overcoding, or the Signifier. It is a system of  *machinic enslavement: *the first "megamachine" in the strict sense, to use Mumford's term. A prodigious success in a single stroke; other States will be mere runts measured against this model. The emperor-despot is not a king or a tyrant; these will come into existence only as a function of private property once it has arisen. 9 In the imperial regime, everything is public: ownership of land is communal, each individual is an owner only insofar as he or she is a member of the community; the eminent property of the des pot is that of the supposed Unity of the communities; and the functionaries themselves have land only if it comes with their position (although the position may be hereditary). Money may exist, notably in the form of the tax that the functionaries owe the emperor, but it is not used for buying-selling, since land does not exist as an alienable commodity. This is the regime of the *nexum, *the bond: something is lent or even given without a transfer of ownership, without private appropriation, and the compensation for it does not come in the form of interest or profit for the donor but rather as a "rent" that accrues to him, accompanying the lending of something for another's use or the granting of revenue. 10 Marx, the historian, and Childe, the archaeologist, are in agreement on the following point: the archaic imperial State, which steps in to overcode agricultural communities, presupposes at least a certain level of devel opment of these communities' productive forces since there must be a potential surplus capable of constituting a State stock, of supporting a spe cialized handicrafts class (metallurgy), and of progressively giving rise to public functions. That is why Marx links the archaic State to a certain "mode of production." However, the origin of these Neolithic States is still being pushed back in time. What is at issue when the existence of near-Paleolithic empires is conjectured is not simply the quantity of time; the qualitative problem changes. Catal Hiiyiik, in Anatolia, makes possible a singularly reinforced imperial paradigm: it is a stock of uncultivated seeds and relatively tame animals from different territories that performs, and makes it possible to perform, at first by chance, hybridizations and selections *from which agriculture and small-scale  animal raising arise.* *11* * *It is easy to see the significance of this change in the givens of the problem. It is no longer the stock that presupposes a potential surplus, but the other way around. It is no longer the State that presupposes advanced agricultural communities and developed forces of production.

It is not the country that progressively creates the town but the town that creates the country. It is not the State that pre supposes a mode of production; quite the opposite, it is the State that makes production a "mode." The last reasons for presuming a progressive development are invalidated. Like seeds in a sack: It all begins with a chance intermixing. The "state and urban revolution" may be Paleolithic, not Neolithic as Childe believed. Evolutionism has been challenged in many different ways (zigzag move ments, stages skipped here or there, irreducible overall breaks). We have seen in particular how Pierre Clastres tried to shatter the evolutionist framework by means of the following two theses: (1) societies termed prim itive are not societies without a State, in the sense that they failed to reach a certain stage, but are counter-State societies organizing mechanisms that ward off the State-form, which make its crystallization impossible; (2) when the State arises, it is in the form of an irreducible break, since it is not the result of a progressive development of the forces of production (even the "Neolithic revolution" cannot be defined in terms of an economic infrastructure). 12 However, one does not depart from evolutionism by establishing a clean break. In the final state of his work, Clastres main tained the preexistence and autarky of counter-State societies, and attrib uted their workings to an overmysterious presentiment of what they warded off and did not yet exist. More generally, one marvels at the bizarre indifference that ethnology manifests for archaeology. It seems as though ethnologists, fenced off in their respective territories, are willing to com pare their territories in an abstract, or structural, way, if it comes to that, but refuse to set them against archaeological territories that would com promise their autarky. They take snapshots of their primitives but rule out in advance the coexistence and superposition of the two maps, the ethnographical and the archaeological. Catal Hiiyuk, however, would have had a zone of influence extending two thousand miles; how can the ever-recurring problem of the relation of coexistence between primitive societies and empires, even those of Paleolithic times, be left unattended to? As long as archaeology is passed over, the question of the relation between ethnology and history is reduced to an idealist confrontation, and fails to wrest itself from the absurd theme of society without history, or society against history. *Everything is not of the State precisely because  there have been States always and everywhere. *Not only does writing presuppose the State, but so do speech and language. The self-sufficiency, autarky, independence, preexistence of primitive communities, is an ethnological dream: not that these communities necessarily depend on States, but they

0 430 □ 7000 B.C.: APPARATUS OF CAPTURE coexist with them in a complex network. It is plausible that "from the beginning" primitive societies have maintained distant ties to one another, not just short-range ones, and that these ties were channeled through States, even if States effected only a partial and local capture of them. Speech communities and languages, independently of writing, do not define closed groups of people who understand one another but primarily determine relations between groups who do not understand one another: if there is language, it is fundamentally between those who do not speak the same tongue. Language is made for that, for translation, not for communi cation. And in primitive societies there are as many tendencies that "seek" the State, as many vectors working in the direction of the State, as there are movements within the State or outside it that tend to stray from it or guard themselves against it, or else to stimulate its evolution, or else already to abolish it: everything coexists, in perpetual interaction. Economic evolutionism is an impossibility; even a ramified evolution, "gatherers—hunters—animal breeders—farmers-industrialists," is hardly believable. An evolutionary ethnology is no better: "nomads— seminomads—sedentaries." Nor an ecological evolutionism: "dispersed autarky of local groups—villages and small towns—cities—States." All we need to do is combine these abstract evolutions to make all of evolutionism crumble; for example, it is the city that creates agriculture, without going through small towns. To take another example, the nomads do not precede the sedentaries; rather, nomadism is a movement, a becoming that affects sedentaries, just as sedentarization is a stoppage that settles the nomads. Griaznov has shown in this connection that the most ancient nomadism can be accurately attributed only to populations that abandoned their semiurban sedentarity, or their primitive itineration, to set off nomadiz ing. 13 It is under these conditions that the nomads invented the war machine, as that which occupies or fills nomad space and opposes towns and States, which its tendency is to abolish. Primitive peoples already had mechanisms of war that converged to prevent the State formation; but these mechanisms change when they gain autonomy in the form of a spe cific nomadism machine that strikes back against the States. We cannot, however, infer from this even a zigzag evolution that would go from primi tive peoples to States, from States to nomad war machines; or at least the zigzagging is not successive but passes through the loci of a topology that defines primitive societies here, States there, and elsewhere war machines. And even when the State appropriates the war machine, once again chang ing its nature, it is a phenomenon of transport, of transfer, and not one of evolution. The nomad exists only in becoming, and in interaction; the same goes for the primitive. All history does is to translate a coexistence of becomings into a succession. And collectivities can be transhumant,

Can it at least be said that the hunter-gatherers are the "true" primitives and remain in spite of it all the basis or minimal presupposition of the State formation, however far back in time we place it? This point of view can be maintained only at the price of a very inadequate conception of causality. And it is true that the human sciences, with their materialist, evolutionary, and even dialectical schemas, lag behind the richness and complexity of causal relations in physics, or even in biology. Physics and biology present us with reverse causalities that are *without finality *but testify nonetheless to an action of the future on the present, or of the present on the past, for example, the convergent wave and the anticipated potential, which imply an inversion of time. More than breaks or zigzags, it is these reverse causal ities that shatter evolution. Similarly, in the present context, it is not ade quate to say that the Neolithic or even Paleolithic State, once it appeared, reacted back on the surrounding world of the hunter-gatherers; it was already acting before it appeared, as the actual limit these primitive socie ties warded off, or as the point toward which they converged but could not reach without self-destructing. These societies simultaneously have vec tors moving in the direction of the State, mechanisms warding it off, and a point of convergence that is repelled, set outside, as fast as it is approached. To ward off is also to anticipate. Of course, it is not at all in the same way that the State appears in existence, and that it preexists in the capacity of a warded-off limit; hence its irreducible contingency. But in order to give a positive meaning to the idea of a "presentiment" of what does not yet exist, it is necessary to demonstrate that what does not yet exist is already in action, in a different form than that of its existence. Once it has appeared, the State reacts back on the hunter-gatherers, imposing upon them agricul ture, animal raising, an extensive division of labor, etc.; it acts, therefore, in the form of a centrifugal or divergent wave. But before appearing, the State already acts in the form of the convergent or centripetal wave of the hunter-gatherers, *a wave that cancels itself out precisely at the point of  convergence marking the inversion of signs or the appearance of the State * (hence the functional and intrinsic instability of these primitive societies). 14 It is necessary from this standpoint to conceptualize the contemporaneousness or coexistence of the two inverse movements, of the two directions of time—of the primitive peoples "before" the State, and of the State "after" the primitive peoples—as if the two waves that seem to us to exclude or succeed each other unfolded simultaneously in an "archaeological," micropo-litical, micrological, molecular field. There exist collective mechanisms that simultaneously ward off and

0 432 □ 7000 B.C.: APPARATUS OF CAPTURE anticipate the formation of a central power. The appearance of a central power is thus a function of *a threshold or degree *beyond which what is anticipated takes on consistency or fails to, and what is conjured away ceases to be so and arrives. This threshold of consistency, or of constraint, is not evolutionary but rather coexists with what has yet to cross it. More over, a distinction must be made between different thresholds of consis tency: the town and the State, however complementary, are not the same thing. The "urban revolution" and the "state revolution" may coincide but do not meld. In both cases, there is a central power, but it does not assume the same figure. Certain authors have made a distinction between the pala tial or imperial system (temple-palace), and the urban, town system. In both cases there is a town, but in one case the town is an outgrowth of the palace or temple, and in the other case the palace, the temple, is a concre tion of the town. In one case, the town par excellence is the capital, and in the other it is the metropolis. Sumer already attests to a town solution, as opposed to the imperial solution of Egypt. But to an even greater extent, it was the Mediterranean world, with the Pelasgians, Phoenicians, Greeks, Carthaginians, that created an urban fabric distinct from the imperial organisms of the Orient. 15 Once again, the question is one not of evolution but of two thresholds of consistency that are themselves coexistent. They differ in several respects. The town is the correlate of the road. The town exists only as a function of circulation, and of circuits; it is a remarkable point on the circuits that create it, and which it creates. It is defined by entries and exits; something must enter it and exit from it. It imposes a frequency. It effects a polariza tion of matter, inert, living or human; it causes the *phylum, *the flow, to pass through specific places, along horizontal lines. It is a phenomenon of  *transconsistency, *a *network, *because it is fundamentally in contact with other towns. It represents a threshold of deterritorialization, because what ever the material involved, it must be deterritorialized enough to enter the network, to submit to the polarization, to follow the circuit of urban and road recoding. The maximum deterritorialization appears in the tendency of maritime and commercial towns to separate off from the backcountry, from the countryside (Athens, Carthage, Venice). The commercial charac ter of the town has often been emphasized, but the commerce in question is also spiritual, as in a network of monasteries or temple-cities. Towns are circuit-points of every kind, which enter into counterpoint along horizon tal lines; they effect a complete but local, town-by-town, integration. Each one constitutes a central power, but it is a power of polarization or of the middle *{milieu), *of forced coordination. That is why this kind of power has egalitarian pretensions, regardless of the form it takes: tyrannical, demo cratic, oligarchic, aristocratic. Town power invents the idea of the *magis-*

The State indeed proceeds otherwise: it is a phenomenon of *intracon-sistency. *It makes points *resonate *together, points that are not necessarily already town-poles but very diverse points of order, geographic, ethnic, linguistic, moral, economic, technological particularities. It makes the town resonate with the countryside. It operates by stratification; in other words, it forms a vertical, hierarchized aggregate that spans the horizontal lines in a dimension of depth. In retaining given elements, it necessarily cuts off their relations with other elements, which become exterior, it inhibits, slows down, or controls those relations; if the State has a circuit of its own, it is an internal circuit dependent primarily upon resonance, it is a zone of recurrence that isolates itself from the remainder of the network, even if in order to do so it must exert even stricter controls over its relations with that remainder. The question is not to find out whether what is retained is natural or artificial (boundaries), because in any event there is deterntorialization. But in this case deterritorialization is a result of the territory itself being taken as an object, as a material to stratify, to make resonate. Thus the central power of the State is hierarchical, and constitutes a civil-service sector; the center is not in the middle *{au milieu), *but on top, because the only way it can recombine what it isolates is through subordination. Of course, there is a multiplicity of States no less than of towns, but it is not the same type of multiplicity: there are as many States as there are vertical cross sections in a dimension of depth, each separated from the others, whereas the town is inseparable from the horizontal network of towns. Each State is a global (not local) integration, a redundancy of resonance (not of frequency), an operation of the stratification of the territory (not of the polarization of the milieu). It is possible to reconstruct how primitive societies warded off both thresholds while at the same time anticipating them. Levi-Strauss has shown that the same villages are susceptible to two presentations, one segmentary and egalitarian, the other encompassing and hierarchized. These are like *two potentials, *one anticipating a central point common to two horizontal segments, the other anticipating a central point external to a straight line. 17 Primitive societies do not lack formations of power; they even have many of them. But what prevents the potential central points from crystallizing, from taking on consistency, are precisely those mecha nisms that keep the formations of power both from resonating together in a higher point and from becoming polarized at a common point: the circles are not concentric, and the two segments require a third segment through which to communicate. 18 This is the sense in which primitive societies have crossed neither the town-threshold nor the State-threshold.

0 434 □ 7000 B.C.: APPARATUS OF CAPTURE If we now turn our attention to the two thresholds of consistency, it is clear that they imply a deterritorialization in relation to the primitive ter ritorial codes. It is futile to ask which came first, the city or the State, the urban or state revolution, because the two are in reciprocal presupposi tion. Both the melodic lines of the towns and the harmonic cross sections of the States are necessary to effect the striation of space. The only ques tion that arises is the possibility that there may be an inverse relation at the heart of this reciprocity. For although the archaic imperial State nec essarily included towns of considerable size, they remained more or less strictly subordinated to the State, depending on how complete the State's monopoly over foreign trade was. On the other hand, the town tended to break free when the State's *overcoding *itself provoked *decoded *flows. A decoding was coupled with the deterritorialization, and amplified it; the necessary recoding was then achieved through a certain autonomy of the towns, or else directly through corporative and commercial towns freed from the State-form. Thus towns arose that no longer had a connection to their own land, because they assured the trade between empires, or better, constituted on their own a free commercial network with other towns. There is therefore an adventure specific to towns in the zones where the most intense decoding occurs, for example, the ancient Aegean world or the Western world of the Middle Ages and the Renaissance. Could it not be said that capitalism is the fruit of the towns, and arises when an urban recoding tends to replace State overcoding? This, however, was not the case. The towns did not create capitalism. The banking and commercial towns, being unproductive and indifferent to the backcountry, did not perform a recoding without also inhibiting the general conjunction of decoded flows. If it is true that they anticipated capitalism, they in turn did not anticipate it without also warding it off. They do not cross this new threshold. Thus it is necessary to expand the hypothesis of mecha nisms both anticipatory and inhibiting: these mechanisms are at play not only in primitive societies but also in the conflict of towns "against" the State *and *"against" capitalism. Finally, it was through the State-form and not the town-form that capitalism triumphed; this occurred when the Western States became models of realization for an axiomatic of decoded flows, and in that way resubjugated the towns. As Braudel says, there were  *"always two runners, *the state and the town"—two forms and two speeds of deterritorialization—and "the state usually won. . . . everywhere in Europe, it disciplined the towns with instinctive relentlessness, whether or not it used violence.. . . [The states] caught up with the forward gallop of the towns." 19 But the relation is a reciprocal one: if it is the modern State that gives capitalism its models of realization, what is thus realized is an independent, worldwide axiomatic that is like a single City,

We define social formations by *machinic processes *and not by modes of production (these on the contrary depend on the processes). Thus primi tive societies are defined by mechanisms of prevention-anticipation; State societies are defined by apparatuses of capture; urban societies, by instru ments of polarization; nomadic societies, by war machines; and finally international, or rather ecumenical, organizations are defined by the encompassment of heterogeneous social formations. But precisely because these processes are variables of coexistence that are the object of a social topology, the various corresponding formations are coexistent. And they coexist in two fashions, extrinsically and intrinsically. Primitive societies cannot ward off the formation of an empire or State without anticipating it, and they cannot anticipate it without its already being there, forming part of their horizon. And States cannot effect a capture unless what is captured coexists, resists in primitive societies, or escapes under new forms, as towns or war machines. . . The numerical composition of the war machine is superposed upon the primitive lineal organization and simultaneously opposes the geometric organization of the State and the physical organiza tion of the town. It is this extrinsic coexistence—interaction—that is brought to its own expression in international aggregates. For these obvi ously did not wait for capitalism before forming: as early as Neolithic times, even Paleolithic, we find traces of ecumenical organizations that tes tify to the existence of long-distance trade, and simultaneously cut across the most varied of social formations (as we have seen in the case of metal lurgy). The problem of diffusion, or of diffusionism, is badly formulated if one assumes a center at which the diffusion would begin. Diffusion occurs only through the placing in communication of potentials of very different orders: all diffusion happens in the in-between, goes between, like every thing that "grows" of the rhizome type. An international ecumenical organization does not proceed from an imperial center that imposes itself upon and homogenizes an exterior milieu; neither is it reducible to rela tions between formations of the same order, between States, for example (the League of Nations, the United Nations). On the contrary, it constitutes an intermediate milieu between the different coexistent orders. Therefore it is not exclusively commercial or economic, but is also religious, artistic, etc. From this standpoint, we shall call an international organization any thing that has the capacity to move through diverse social formations simultaneously: States, towns, deserts, war machines, primitive societies. The great commercial formations in history do not simply have city-poles, but also primitive, imperial, and nomadic segments through which they pass, perhaps issuing out again in another form.

0 436 □ 7000 B.C.: APPARATUS OF CAPTURE rect in saying that there can be no economic theory of international rela tions, even economic ones, because they sit astride heterogeneous forma tions. 20 The point of departure for ecumenical organization is not a State, even an imperial one; the imperial State is only one part of it, and it consti tutes a part of it in its own mode, according to its own order, which consists in capturing everything it can. It does not proceed by progressive homoge-nization, or by totalization, but by the taking on of consistency or the consolidation of the diverse as such. For example, monotheistic religion is distinguished from territorial worship by its pretension to universality. But this pretension is not homogenizing, it makes itself felt only by spreading everywhere; this was the case with Christianity, which became imperial and urban, but not without giving rise to bands, deserts, war machines of its own. 21 Similarly, there is no artistic movement that does not have its towns and empires, but also its nomads, bands, and primitives. It might be objected that, at least in the case of capitalism, international economic relations, and at the limit all international relations, tend toward the homogenization of social formations. One could cite not only the cold and concerted destruction of primitive societies but also the fall of the last despotic formations, for example, the Ottoman Empire, which met capi talist demands with too much resistance and inertia. This objection, how ever, is only partially accurate. To the extent that capitalism constitutes an axiomatic (production for the market), all States and all social formations tend to become *isomorphic *in their capacity as models of realization: there is but one centered world market, the capitalist one, in which even the so-called socialist countries participate. Worldwide organization thus ceases to pass "between" heterogeneous formations since it assures the isomorphy of those formations. But it would be wrong to confuse isomorphy with homogeneity. For one thing, isomorphy allows, and even incites, a great heterogeneity among States (democratic, totalitarian, and, especially, "socialist" States are not facades). For another thing, the international capitalist axiomatic effectively assures the isomorphy of the diverse formations only where the domestic market is developing and expanding, in other words, in "the center." But it tolerates, in fact it requires, a certain peripheral polymorphy, to the extent that it is not satu rated, to the extent that it actively repels its own limits; 22 this explains the existence, at the periphery, of heteromorphic social formations, *which cer-  tainly do not constitute vestiges or transitional forms *since they realize an ultramodern capitalist production (oil, mines, plantations, industrial equipment, steel, chemistry), but which are nonetheless precapitalist, or extracapitalist, owing to other aspects of their production and to the forced inadequacy of their domestic market in relation to the world market. 23 When international organization becomes the capitalist axiomatic, it con

There is not only an external coexistence of formations but also an intrinsic coexistence of machinic processes. Each process can also function at a "power" other than its own; it can be taken up by a power correspond ing to another process. The State as apparatus of capture has a *power of  appropriation; *but this power does not consist solely in capturing all that it can, all that is possible, of a matter defined as *phylum. *The apparatus of capture also appropriates the war machine, the instruments of polariza tion, and the anticipation-prevention mechanisms. This is to say, con versely, that anticipation-prevention mechanisms have a high *power of  transference: *they are at work not only in primitive societies, but move into the towns that ward off the State-form, into the States that ward off capital ism, into capitalism itself, insofar as it wards off and repels its own limits. And they are not satisfied to switch over to other powers but form new focal points of resistance and contagion, as we have seen in the case of "band" phenomena, which have their own towns, their own brand of international ism, etc. Similarly, war machines have *a power of metamorphosis, *which of course allows them to be captured by States, but also to resist that capture and rise up again in other forms, with other "objects" besides war (revolu tion?). Each power is a force of deterritorialization that can go along with the others or go against them (even primitive societies have their vectors of deterritorialization). Each process can switch over to other powers, but also subordinate other processes to its own power. P ROPOSITION XII. *Capture.* Is it possible to conceive of an "exchange" between separate primitive groups, independent of any reference to such notions as stock, labor, and commodity? It seems that a modified marginalism provides a basis for a hypothesis. For the interest of marginalism resides not in its economic the ory, which is extremely weak, but in a logical power that makes Jevons, for example, a kind of Lewis Carroll of economics. Take two abstract groups, one of which (A) gives seeds and receives axes, while the other (B) does the opposite. What is the collective evaluation of the objects based on? It is based on the *idea *of the last objects received, or rather receivable, on each side. By "last" or "marginal" we must understand not the most recent, nor the final, but rather the penultimate, the next to the last, in other words, the last one *before *the apparent exchange loses its appeal for the exchangers, or forces them to modify their respective assemblages, to enter another assemblage. We will consider that the farmer-gatherer group A, which receives axes, has an "idea" of the number of axes that would force it to change assemblage; and the manufacturing group B, of the quantity of

We may say, then, that the seed-ax relation is determined by the last quantity of seeds (for group B) corresponding to the last ax (for group A). The last as the object of a collec tive evaluation determines the value of the entire series. It marks the exact point at which the assemblage must reproduce itself, begin a new operation period or a new cycle, lodge itself on another territory, and beyond which the assemblage could not continue as such. This is indeed a next-to-the-last, a penultimate, since it comes before the ultimate. The ultimate is when the assemblage must change its nature: B would have to plant the excess seeds. A would have to increase the rhythm of its own plantings and remain on the same land. We can now posit a conceptual difference between the "limit" and the "threshold": the limit designates the penultimate marking a necessary rebeginning, and the threshold the ultimate marking an inevitable change. It is an economic given of every enterprise to include an evaluation of the limit beyond which the enterprise would have to modify its structure. Marginalism claims to demonstrate the frequency of this penultimate mechanism: it applies not only to the last exchangeable objects but also to the last producible object, or the last producer him- or herself, the marginal or limit-producer before the assemblage changes. 24 This is an economics of everyday life. For example, what does an alcoholic call the *last glass? *The alcoholic makes a subjective evaluation of how much he or she can tolerate. What can be tolerated is precisely the limit at which, as the alcoholic sees it, he or she will be able to start over again (after a rest, a pause ...). But beyond that limit there lies a threshold that would cause the alcoholic to change assemblage: it would change either the nature of the drinks or the customary places and hours of the drinking. Or worse yet, the alcoholic would enter a suicidal assemblage, or a medical, hospital assemblage, etc. It is of little importance that the alcoholic may be fooling him- or herself, or makes a very ambiguous use of the theme "I'm going to stop," the theme of the last one. What counts is the existence of a spontaneous marginal crite rion and marginalist evaluation determining the value of the entire series of "glasses." The same goes for having *the last wordin *a domestic-squabble assemblage. Both partners evaluate from the start the volume or density of the last word that would give them the advantage and conclude the discus sion, marking the end of an operation period or cycle of the assemblage, allowing it to start all over again. Both calculate their words in accordance with their evaluation of this last word, and the vaguely agreed time for it to come. And beyond the last (penultimate) word there lie still other words, this time final words that would cause them to enter another assemblage, divorce, for example, because they would have overstepped "bounds."

But once again, "beyond" lies the ultimate, at the point where the assem blage changes, where the assemblage of love is superseded by an artistic assemblage—the Work to be written, which is the problem Proust tackles... Exchange is only an appearance: each partner or group assesses the value of the last receivable object (limit-object), and the apparent equiva lence derives from that. The equalization results from the two heterogene ous series, the exchange or communication results from two monologues  *(palabre). *There is neither exchange value nor use value but rather an eval uation of the last by both parties (a calculation of the risk involved in cross ing the limit), an anticipation-evaluation that takes into account the ritual character as well as the utilitarian, the serial character as well as the exchangist. The evaluation of the limit is there from the start in both groups, and already governs the first "exchange" between them. Of course there is groping in the dark; the evaluation is inseparable from a collective feeling out. But it does not bear on the quantity of social labor but on the idea of the last on both sides; the speed with which it is accomplished var ies, but it is always done faster than the time necessary effectively to arrive at the last object, or even to pass from one operation to another. 25 This is the sense in which the evaluation is essentially anticipatory, that it is already present in the first terms of the series. It can be seen that marginal utility (pertaining to the last objects receivable on both sides) is relative not to an abstractly posited stock but to the respective assemblages of the two groups. Pareto was moving in this direction when he spoke of "ophelimity" rather than of marginal utility. 26 The issue is one of*desirability *as an assem blage component: every group desires according to the value of the last receivable object beyond which it would be obliged to change assemblage. And every assemblage has two sides, the machining of bodies or objects, and group enunciation. The evaluation of the last is the collective enuncia tion to which the *entire series *of objects corresponds; in other words, it is an assemblage cycle or operation period. Exchangist primitive groups thus appear to be serial groups. Theirs is a special regime, even with respect to violence. For even violence can be submitted to a marginal ritual treat ment, that is, to an evaluation of the "last violence" insofar as it impreg nates the entire series of blows (beyond which another regime of violence would begin). We previously defined primitive societies by the existence of  *anticipation-prevention *mechanisms. Now we can see more clearly how these mechanisms are constituted and distributed: it is the evaluation of the last as limit that constitutes an anticipation and simultaneously wards off the last as threshold or ultimate (a new assemblage).

0 440 □ 7000 B.C.: APPARATUS OF CAPTURE The threshold comes "after" the limit, "after" the last receivable objects: it marks the moment when the apparent exchange is no longer of interest. We believe that it is precisely at this moment that stockpiling begins; be forehand, there may be exchange granaries, granaries specifically for exchange purposes, but there is no stock in the strict sense. Exchange does not assume a preexistent stock, it assumes only a certain "elasticity." Stock piling begins only once exchange has lost its interest, its desirability for both parties. Additionally, conditions must exist giving stockpiling an interest in its own right, a desirability of its own (otherwise, the objects would be destroyed or depleted rather than stockpiled: depletion is the means by which primitive groups ward off the stock and maintain their assemblage). The stock depends on a new type of assemblage. The expres sions "after," "new," "to be superseded" are doubtless very ambiguous. The threshold is in fact already there, but outside the limit, which is satisfied to place the threshold at a distance, keep it at a distance. The problem is to know what this other assemblage is that gives the stock an actual interest, a desirability. The stock seems to us to have a necessary correlate: *either the  coexistence of simultaneously exploited territories, or a succession of exploi-  tations on one and the same territory. *It is at this point that the territories form a Land, are superseded by a Land. This is the assemblage that neces sarily includes stockpiling, and which constitutes in the first case an exten sive system of cultivation, in the second case an intensive system of cultivation (following Jane Jacobs's paradigm). The way in which the stock-threshold differs from the exchange-limit is now clear: primitive assemblages of hunter-gatherers have an operation period defined by the exploitation of a territory; the law is one of temporal succession because the assemblage perseveres only by switching territories at the conclusion of each operation period (itinerancy, itineration); and within each operation period there is a repetition or temporal series that tends toward the last object as an "index," as the marginal or limit-object of the territory (this iteration will govern the apparent exchange). On the other hand, in the other assemblage, in the stock assemblage, the law is one of spatial coexis tence and concerns the simultaneous exploitation of different territories; or, when the exploitation is successive, the succession of operation periods bears on one and the same territory; and in the framework of each opera tion period or exploitation the force of serial iteration is superseded by a power of symmetry, reflection, and global comparison. In solely descrip tive terms, we therefore distinguish between serial, itinerant, or territorial assemblages (which operate by codes) and sedentary, global, or Land assemblages (which operate by overcoding). Ground rent, in its abstract model, appears precisely when a compari son is drawn between different simultaneously exploited territories, or

The worst land (or the poorest exploitation) bears no rent, but it makes it so that the other soils do bear rent, "produce" it in a comparative way. 27 A stock is what per mits the yields to be compared (the same planting on different soils, or various successive plantings on the same soil). The category of the *last *con firms once again its economic importance, but it has totally changed mean ing: it no longer designates the end point of a self-fulfilling movement but the center of symmetry for two movements, one of which is descending and the other ascending; it no longer designates the limit of an ordinal series but the lowest element in a cardinal set, that set's threshold—the least fer tile land in the set of simultaneously exploited lands. 28 Ground rent homogenizes, equalizes different conditions of productivity by linking the excess of the highest conditions of productivity over the lowest to a *land-  owner: *since the price (profit included) is established on the basis of the least productive land, rent taps the surplus profit accruing to the best lands; it taps "the difference between the product of two equal amounts of capital and labor." 29 This is the very model of an apparatus of capture, inseparable from a process of relative deterritorialization. The land as the object of agriculture in fact implies a deterritorialization, because instead of people being distributed in an itinerant territory, pieces of land are distributed among people according to a common quantitative criterion (the fertility of plots of equal surface area). That is why the earth, unlike other elements, forms the basis of a striation, proceeding by geometry, symmetry, and com parison. The other elements, water, air, wind, and subsoil, cannot be stri ated and for that very reason bear rent only by virtue of their emplacement, in other words, as a function of the land. 30 The land has two potentialities of deterritorialization: (1) its differences in quality are *comparable to *one another, from the standpoint of a quantity establishing a correspondence between them and exploitable pieces of land; (2) the set of exploited lands is *appropriable, *as opposed to exterior unclaimed land, from the stand point of a monopoly that fixes the landowner or -owners. 31 The second potentiality is the necessary condition for the first. Both were warded off by the territory's territorialization of the earth but are now effectuated in the agricultural assemblage thanks to stockpiling, by means of a deter ritorialization of the territory. Land as compared and appropriated ex tracts from the territories a center of convergence located outside them; the land is an idea of the town. Rent is not the only apparatus of capture. The stock has as its correlate not only the land, from the double point of view of the comparison of lands and the monopolistic appropriation of land; it has work as another corre late, from the double point of view of the comparison of activities and the monopolistic appropriation of labor (surplus labor).

0 442 □ 7000 B.C.: APPARATUS OF CAPTURE virtue of the stock that activities of the "free action" type come to be com pared, linked, and subordinated to a common and homogeneous quantity called labor. Not only does labor concern the stock—either its constitu tion, conservation, reconstitution, or utilization—but labor itself is stock piled activity, just as the worker is a stockpiled "actant." Moreover, even when labor is clearly separated from surplus labor, they cannot be held to be independent: there is no so-called necessary labor, and beyond that sur plus labor. Labor and surplus labor are strictly the same thing; the first term is applied to the quantitative comparison of activities, the second to the monopolistic appropriation of labor by the entrepreneur (and no longer the landowner). As we have seen, even when they are distinct and separate, there is no labor that is not predicated on surplus labor. Surplus labor is not that which exceeds labor; on the contrary, labor is that which is subtracted from surplus labor and presupposes it. It is only in this context that one may speak of labor value, and of an evaluation bearing on the quantity of social labor, whereas primitive groups were under a regime of free action or activity in continuous variation. Since it depends on surplus labor and sur plus value, entrepreneurial profit is just as much an apparatus of capture as proprietary rent: not only does surplus labor capture labor, and landownership the earth, but labor and surplus labor are the apparatus of capture of activity, just as the comparison of lands and the appropriation of land are the apparatus of capture of the territory. 32 Finally, there is a third apparatus of capture in addition to rent and profit: taxation. To understand this third form, and its creative range, we must first determine the internal relation upon which the commodity depends. Edouard Will has shown, in relation to the Greek city and in par ticular the Corinthian tyranny, that money derived not from exchange, the commodity, or the demands of commerce, but from taxation, which first introduces the possibility of an equivalence money = goods or services and which makes money a general equivalent. In effect, money is a correlate of the stock; it is a subset of the stock in that it can be constituted by any object that can be preserved over the long term. In the case of Corinth, metal money was first distributed to the "poor" (in their capacity as producers). who used it to by land rights; it thus passed into the hands of the "rich," on the condition that it not stop there, that everyone, rich and poor, pay a tax, the poor in goods or services, the rich in money, such that an equivalence money-goods and services was established. 33 We will return to the signifi cance of this reference to rich and poor in the already late case of Corinth. But beyond the context and particularities of this example, money is always distributed by an apparatus of power under conditions of conservation, circulation, and turnover, so that an equivalence goods-services-money can be established. We therefore do not believe in a succession.

0 7000 B.C.: APPARATUS OF CAPTURE □ 443 according to which labor rent would come first, followed by rent in kind,  followed by money rent. 34 It is directly in taxation that the equivalence and simultaneity of the three develop. As a general rule, it is taxation that  monetarizes the economy; it is taxation that creates money, and it neces-  sarily creates it in motion, in circulation, with turnover, and also in a corre-  spondence with services and goods in the current of that circulation. The  State finds in taxation the means for foreign trade, insofar as it appropri-  ates that trade. Yet it is not from trade but from taxation that the  money-form derives. 35 And the money-form thus derived from taxation makes possible a monopolistic appropriation of outside exchange by the  State (monetarized trade). Everything is different in the regime of  exchanges. We are no longer in the "primitive" situation where exchange is  carried out indirectly, subjectively, through the respective equalization of  the last receivable objects (the law of demand). Of course, exchange  remains what it is in essence, that is to say, unequal, productive of an  equalization resulting from inequality: but this time there is direct  comparison, objective pricing, and monetary equalization (the law of  supply). It is through taxation that goods and services come to be like  commodities, and the commodity comes to be measured and equalized by  money. That is why, even today, the meaning and impact of taxation  appear in what is called indirect taxation, in other words, a tax that is  included in the price and influences the value of the commodity,  independent of and outside the market. 36 However, the indirect tax is not simply an additional element that is tacked onto prices and inflates them. It  is only the index or expression of a deeper movement, in which the tax  constitutes the first layer of an "objective" price, the monetary magnet to  which the other elements—price, rent, and profit—add on and adhere,  converging in the same apparatus of capture. It was a great moment in  capitalism when the capitalists realized that taxation could be productive,  that it could be particularly favorable to profits and even to rents. But as  with indirect taxation, this is a favorable case; it should not obscure an  even deeper and more archaic accord, a convergence and essential identity  between three aspects of a single apparatus. A three-headed apparatus of  capture, a "trinity formula" derived from that of Marx (although it  distributes things differently): 37 LAND (as opposed to territory) a) Direct comparison of lands, dif ferential rent; b) Monopolistic appropriation of land, absolute rent.

The stock has three simultaneous aspects: land and seeds, tools, money. Land is stockpiled territory, the tool is stockpiled activity, and money is stockpiled exchange. But the stock does not *come *from either ter ritories, activities, or exchanges. It marks another assemblage; it comes from that other assemblage. 2. That assemblage is the "megamachine," or the apparatus of capture, the archaic empire. It functions in three modes, which correspond to the three aspects of the stock: rent, profit, taxation. And the three modes con verge and coincide in it, in an agency of overcoding (or signifiance): the despot, at once the eminent landowner, entrepreneur of large-scale proj ects, and master of taxes and prices. This is like three capitalizations of power, or three articulations of "capital." 3. What forms the apparatus of capture are two operations always found in the convergent modes: direct comparison and monopolistic appropriation. And the comparison always presupposes the appropriation: labor presupposes surplus labor; differential rent presupposes absolute rent; commercial money presupposes taxation. The apparatus of capture constitutes a general space of comparison and a mobile center of appropriation. This is a white wall/black hole system of the kind that, as we have seen, constitutes the *face *of the despot. A point of resonance circu lates in a space of comparison and constitutes that space as it circulates. That is what distinguishes the State apparatus from primitive mecha nisms, with their noncoexistent territories and nonresonating centers.

Apparatus of capture—the semiological operation par excellence... (In this sense, the associationist philosophers were not wrong in explaining political power by operations of the mind dependent upon the association of ideas.) Bernard Schmitt has proposed a model of the apparatus of capture that takes into account the operations of comparison and appropriation. This model admittedly revolves around money as a capitalist economics. But it seems to be based on abstract principles that transcend these limits. 38 A. The point of departure is an undivided flow that has yet to be ap propriated or compared, a "pure availability," "nonpossession and non wealth": this is precisely what occurs when banks create money, but taken more generally it is the establishment of the stock, which is the creation of an undivided flow. B. The undivided flow becomes divided to the extent it is allocated to the "factors," distributed to the "factors." There is only one kind of factor, the immediate producers. We could call them the "poor" and say that the flow is distributed among the poor. But this would be inaccurate because there are no preexistent "rich." What counts, the important thing, is that the producers do not yet acquire possession of what is distributed to them, and that what is distributed to them is not yet wealth: *remuneration * assumes neither comparison and appropriation, nor buying-selling; it is much more an operation of the *nexum *type. There is only equality between set B and set A, between the distributed set and the undivided set. The dis tributed set could be called *nominal wage; *nominal wages are the form of expression of the entire undivided set ("the entire nominal expression," or as it is often put, "the expression of total national income"). This is the point at which the apparatus of capture becomes semiological. C. Thus it cannot even be said that wages, conceived as distribution, remuneration, constitute a purchase; on the contrary, purchasing power derives from wages: "The remuneration of the producers is not a purchase, it is the operation by which purchasing becomes possible in a second moment, when money begins to exercise its new power." It is after it has been distributed that set B becomes wealth, or acquires a comparative power, in relation to something else entirely. This something else is the determinate set of the goods that have been produced and are thus purchas able. At first heterogeneous to goods and products, money later becomes a good homogeneous to the products it can buy; it acquires a purchasing power that is extinguished with the real purchase. Or more generally, between the two sets, the distributed set B and the set of real goods C, there

0 446 □ 7000 B.C.: APPARATUS OF CAPTURE is established a *correspondence, *a *comparison *("the power of acquisition is created in direct conjunction with the set of real productions"). D. This is where the mystery or the magic resides, in a kind of disjunc tion. For if we call B' the comparative set, in other words, the set placed in correspondence with the real goods, we see that it is necessarily smaller than the distributed set. B' is necessarily smaller than B: even if we assume that purchasing power has available to it all of the objects produced during a given period, the distributed set is always greater than the set that is used or compared, meaning that the immediate producers are able to convert only a portion of the distributed set. *Real wages *are only a portion of nomi nal wages; similarly, "useful" labor is only a portion of labor, and "utilized" land is only a portion of the land that has been distributed. We shall call Capture this difference or excess constitutive of profit, surplus labor, or the surplus product: "Nominal wages include everything, but the wage-earners retain only the income *they succeed in converting into goods; *they lose the income siphoned off by the enterprises." It can be said that the whole was in fact distributed to the "poor"; the poor, however, find themselves extorted of everything they do not succeed in converting in the course of this strange race: the capture effects an inversion of the wave or of the divisible flow. It is precisely capture that is the object of monopolistic appropriation. And this appropriation (by the "rich") does not come after: it is included in nominal wages, while eluding real wages. It is between the two, it inserts itself between the distribution without possession and the conversion by correspondence or comparison; it expresses the difference in power between the two sets, between B' and B. In the end, there is no mystery at all: *the mechanism of capture contributes from the outset to the constitution  of the aggregate upon which the capture is effectuated.* This schema, according to its author, is very difficult to understand, and yet it is operative. It consists in bringing into relief an abstract machine of capture or of extortion by presenting a very specific "order of reasons." For example, remuneration is not itself a purchase since purchasing power derives from it. As Schmitt says, there is neither thief nor victim, for the producer only loses what he does not have and has no chance of acquiring: as in seventeenth-century philosophy, there are negations but not priva tion .. . And everything coexists in this logical apparatus of capture. Any succession is purely logical: the capture in itself appears between B and C, but exists as well between A and B, between C and A; it impregnates the entire apparatus, it acts as a nonlocalizable liaison for the system. The same goes for surplus labor: How could one specify its location since labor presupposes it? Now the State—the archaic imperial State in any case—is this very apparatus. It is always a mistake to appeal to a supplementary explanation for the State: this pushes the State back behind the State, ad

It is enough for this point of comparison and appropriation to be effectively occupied in order for the apparatus of capture to function, an apparatus that overcodes the primi tive codes, substitutes sets for the series, or reverses the direction of the signs. This point is necessarily occupied, effectuated, because it already exists in the convergent wave that moves through the primitive series and draws them toward a threshold at which, after passing their limits, the wave itself changes direction. Primitive peoples have always existed only as ves tiges, already plied by the reversible wave that carries them off (vector of deterritorialization). What is contingent upon external circumstances is only the place where the apparatus is effectuated—the place where the agricultural "mode of production" was able to arise: the Orient. It is in this sense that the apparatus is abstract. But in itself, it marks not simply an abstract possibility of reversibility but the real existence of a point of inver sion as an autonomous, irreducible phenomenon. Hence the very particular character of State violence: it is very difficult to pinpoint this violence because it always presents itself as preaccom-plished. It is not even adequate to say that the violence rests with the mode of production. Marx made the observation in the case of capitalism: there is a violence *that necessarily operates through the State, * precedes the capitalist mode of production, constitutes the "primitive accumulation," and makes possible the capitalist mode of production itself. From a standpoint within the capitalist mode of production, it is very difficult to say who is the thief and who the victim, or even where the violence resides. That is because the worker is born entirely naked and the capitalist objectively "clothed," an independent owner. That which gave the worker and the capitalist this form eludes us because it operated in other modes of production. It is a violence that posits itself as preaccomplished, even though it is reactivated every day. 39 This is the place to say it, if ever there was one: *the mutilation is prior, preestablished. *However, these analyses of Marx should be enlarged upon. For the fact remains that there is a primitive accumulation that, far from deriving from the agricultural mode of production, precedes it: as a general rule, there is primitive accumulation whenever an apparatus of capture is mounted, with that very particular kind of violence that creates or contributes to the creation of that which it is directed against, and thus presupposes itself. 40 The problem then becomes one of distinguishing between regimes of violence. We can draw a distinction between struggle, war, crime and policing as so many regimes of violence. *Struggle *would be like the regime of primitive violence (including primitive "wars"); it is a blow-by-blow violence, which is not without its code, since the value of the blows is fixed according to the law of the series, as a function of the value of

But *State policing or lawful violence *is some thing else again, because it consists in capturing while simultaneously constituting a right to capture. It is an incorporated, structural violence distinct from every kind of direct violence. The State has often been defined by a "monopoly of violence," but this definition leads back to another definition that describes the State as a "state of Law"  *(Rechts-staat). *State overcoding is precisely this structural violence that defines the law, "police" violence and not the violence of war. There is lawful violence wherever violence contributes to the creation of that which it is used against, or as Marx says, wherever capture contributes to the creation of that which it captures. This is very different from criminal violence. It is also why, *in contradistinction to *primitive violence, State or lawful violence always seems to presuppose itself, for it preexists its own use: the State can in this way say that violence is "primal," that it is simply a natural phenomenon the responsibility for which does not lie with the State, which uses violence only against the violent, against "criminals"—against primitives, against nomads—in order that peace may reign. P ROPOSITION XIII. *The State and its forms.* We start with the archaic imperial State: overcoding, apparatus of cap ture, machine of enslavement. It comprises a particular kind of property, money, public works—a formula complete in a single stroke but one that presupposes nothing "private" and does not even assume a preexistent mode of production since it is what gives rise to the mode of production. The point of departure that the preceding analyses give us is well estab lished by archaeology. The question now becomes: Once the State has appeared, formed in a single stroke, how will it evolve? What are its factors of evolution or mutation, and what is the relation between evolved States and the archaic imperial State? The principle of evolution is internal, whatever the external factors that contribute to it. *The archaic State does not overcode without also freeing a  large quantity of decoded flows that escape from it. *Let us recall that "decod ing" does not signify the state of a flow whose code is understood *(compris) * (deciphered, translatable, assimilable), but, in a more radical sense, the

But on the other hand, *the overcoding of the archaic State itself makes  possible and gives rise to new flows that escape from it. *The State does not  created large-scale works without a flow of independent labor escaping its  bureaucracy (notably in the mines and in metallurgy).

For private property can arise neither on  the side of the emperor-despot not on the side of the peasants, whose autonomy  is tied to communal possession, nor on the side of the functionaries whose  existence and income are based on that public communal form ("the aristocrats  can under these conditions become petty despots but not private landowners").  Even the slaves belong to the community or the public function. The question  then becomes, Are there people who are constituted in the overcoding empire,  but constituted as necessarily excluded and decoded? Tokei's answer is the *freed  slaves. *It is they who have no place. It is their lamentations that are heard the  length and breadth of the Chinese Empire: the plaint (elegy) has always been a  political factor. But it is also they who form the first seeds of private property,  who develop trade, and with metallurgy invent a kind of private slavery in which  they will be the new master. 41 We saw previously the role played by freed slaves in the war machine, in the formation of the special body. It is in a different form,  and following entirely different principles, that they play an important role in the  State apparatus and in the evolution of that apparatus, this time in the formation  of a private body. The two aspects can combine, but they belong to two different  lines. What counts is not the particular case of the freed slave.What counts is the collective figure of the Outsider. What counts is that in one way or another the  apparatus of overcoding gives rise to flows that are themselves decoded—flows  of money, labor, property. . . These flows are the correlate of the apparatus. And  the correlation is not only social, internal to the archaic empire, it is also  geographical. This would be the place to bring up

0 450 □ 7000 B.C.: APPARATUS OF CAPTURE the confrontation between the East and the West. According to V. Gordon Childe's great archaeological thesis, the archaic imperial State implies a stockpiled agricultural surplus, which makes possible the maintenance of a specialized body of mercantile and metallurgical artisans. Indeed, the sur plus as the content proper to overcoding must be not only stockpiled but absorbed, consumed, realized. Doubtless, this economic requirement that the surplus be absorbed is one of the principal aspects of the appropriation of the war machine by the imperial State: The military institution is from the start one of the most effective means of absorbing surplus. If, however, we assume that the bureaucratic and military institutions are not enough, the way is cleared for this specialized body of nonagricultural artisans, whose labor will reinforce the sedentarization of agriculture. It was in Afro-Asia and the Orient that all of these conditions were fulfilled and that the State apparatus was invented: in the Middle East, Egypt, and Mesopotamia, but also in the valley of the Indus (and in the Far East). That was where agricultural stock and its bureaucratic, military, but also metallurgical and commercial concomitants came into being. But this oriental or imperial "solution" is threatened by an impasse: State overcoding keeps the metallurgists, both craft and mercantile, within strict bounds, under powerful bureaucratic control, with monopolistic appropriation of foreign trade in the service of a ruling class, so that the peasants themselves benefit little from the State innovations. So it is indeed true that the State-form spreads and that archaeology discovers it everywhere on the horizon of Western history in the Aegean world. But not under the same conditions. Minos and Mycenae are more a caricature of an empire, Agamemnon of Mycenae is not the Chinese emperor or Egyptian pharaoh; the Egyptian can say to the Greeks: "You will always be like children..." That is because the Aegean peoples were both too far away to fall into the oriental sphere and too poor to stockpile a surplus themselves, but neither far enough away nor impoverished enough to ignore the markets of the Orient. Moreover, oriental overcoding itself assigned its merchants a long-distance role. Thus the Aegean peoples found themselves in a situation where they could take advantage of the oriental agricultural stock *without having to constitute one for themselves: * they plundered it when they could, and on a more regular basis procured a share of it in exchange for raw materials (notably wood and metals), coming from as far away as Central and Western Europe. Of course, the Orient continually had to reproduce its stocks; but formally, it had made a move "once and for all," from which the West benefited without having to reproduce it. It follows that the metallurgical artisans and the merchants assumed an entirely different status in the West, since their existence did not directly depend on a surplus accumulated by a local State apparatus: even if the peasant suffered an exploitation as bad as or worse

Many metallur gists and merchants from the Orient moved to the Aegean world, where they were to find freer, more varied and more stable conditions. In short,  *the same flows that are overcoded in the Orient tend to become decoded in  Europe, *in a new situation that is like the flipside or correlate of the other. Surplus value is no longer surplus value of code (overcoding) but becomes surplus value of flow. It is as if two solutions were found for the same prob lem, the Oriental solution and then the Western one, which grafts itself upon the first and brings it out of the impasse while continuing to presup pose it. The European metallurgist and merchant faced a much less thor oughly coded international market, one not limited to an imperial house or class. And as Childe said, the Western and Aegean States were immersed in a supranational economic system from the start; they bathed in it, instead of containing it within the limits of their own net. 42 It is indeed another pole of the State that arises, one that could be defined in summary fashion as follows. The *public sphere *no longer charac terizes the objective nature of property but is instead the shared means for a now private appropriation; this yields the public-private mixes constitu tive of the modern world. *The bond becomes personal; *personal relations of dependence, both between owners (contracts) and between owned and owners (conventions), parallel or replace community relations or relations based on one's public function. Even slavery changes; it no longer defines the public availability of the communal worker but rather private property as applied to individual workers. 43 The *law *in its entirety undergoes a mutation, becoming subjective, conjunctive, "topical" law: this is because the State apparatus is faced with a new task, which consists less in overcoding already coded flows than in *organizing conjunctions of decoded  flows as such. *Thus the regime of signs has changed: in all of these respects, the operation of the imperial "signifier" has been superseded by *processes  of subjedification; *machinic enslavement tends to be replaced by a regime of *social subjection. *And unlike the relatively uniform imperial pole, this second pole presents the most diverse of forms. But as varied as relations of personal dependence are, they always mark qualified and topical conjunc tions. It was the evolved empires, of the East and of the West, that first developed this new public sphere *of the *private, through institutions such as the *consilium *and the *fiscus *in the Roman Empire (it was through these institutions that freed slaves acquired a political power paralleling that of the functionaries). 44 But it was also the autonomous cities, the feudal sys tems. .. The question as to whether these last-mentioned formations still answer to the concept of the State can be formulated only after certain cor relations have been taken into account. Every bit as much as the evolved

In a beautiful passage, Edgar Quinet underlines this coincidence between "the delirium of the twelve Cesars and the golden age of Roman law." 46 The subjectifications, conjunctions, and appropriations do not prevent the decoded flows from continuing to flow, and from ceaselessly engender ing new flows that escape (we saw this, for example, at the level of a micropolitics of the Middle Ages). This is where there is an ambiguity in these apparatuses: they can only function with decoded flows, and yet they do not let them stream together; they perform topical conjunctions that stand as so many knots or recodings. This accounts for the historians' impression that capitalism "could have" developed beginning at a certain moment, in China, in Rome, in Byzantium, in the Middle Ages, that the conditions for it existed but were not effectuated or even capable of being effectuated. The situation is that the pressure of the flows draws capitalism in negative outline, but for it to be realized there must be a whole *integral of  decoded flows, *a whole *generalized conjunction *that overspills and over turns the preceding apparatuses. And in fact when Marx sets about defin ing capitalism, he begins by invoking the advent of a single unqualified and global Subjectivity, which capitalizes all of the processes of subjectifica-tion, "all activities without distinction": "productive activity in general," "the sole subjective essence of wealth . . ." And this single Subject now expresses itself in an Object in general, no longer in this or that qualitative state: "Along with the abstract universality of wealth-creating activity we have now the universality of the object defined as wealth, viz. the product in general, or labor in general, but as past, materialized labor." 47 Circulation constitutes capital as a subjectivity commensurate with society in its entirety. But this new social subjectivity can form only to the extent that the decoded flows overspill their conjunctions and attain a level of decoding that the State apparatuses are no longer able to reclaim: *on the one hand, *the flow of labor must no longer be determined as slavery or serfdom but must become naked and free labor; and *on the other hand, *wealth must no longer be determined as money dealing, merchant's or landed wealth, but must become pure homogeneous and independent capital.

But it is their abstract conjunction in a single stroke that constitutes capitalism, providing a universal subject and an object in general for one another. Cap italism forms when the flow of unqualified wealth encounters the flow of unqualified labor and conjugates with it. 48 This is what the preceding con junctions, which were still topical or qualitative, had always inhibited (the two principal inhibitors were the feudal organization of the countryside and the corporative organization of the towns). This amounts to saying that capitalism forms with *a general axiomatic of decoded flows. *"Capital is a right, or, to be more precise, a relation of production that is manifested as a right, and as such it is independent of the concrete form that it cloaks at each moment of its productive function." 49 Private property no longer expresses the bond of personal dependence but the independence of a Sub ject that now constitutes the sole bond. This makes for an important differ ence in the evolution of private property: private property in itself relates to rights, instead of the law relating it to the land, things, or people (this raises in particular the famous question of the elimination of ground rent in capitalism). *A new threshold of deterritorialization. *And when capital becomes an active right in this way, the entire historical figure of the law changes. The law ceases to be the overcoding of customs, as it was in the archaic empire; it is no longer a set of topics, as it was in the evolved States, the autonomous cities, and the feudal systems; it increasingly assumes the direct form and immediate characteristics of an axiomatic, as evidenced in our civil "code." 50 When the flows reach this capitalist threshold of decoding and deterri torialization (naked labor, independent capital), it seems that there is no longer a need for a State, for distinct juridical and political domination, in order to ensure appropriation, which has become directly economic. The economy constitutes a worldwide axiomatic, a "universal cosmopolitan energy which overflows every restriction and bond," 51 a mobile and con vertible substance "such as the total value of annual production." Today we can depict an enormous, so-called stateless, monetary mass that circulates through foreign exchange and across borders, eluding control by the States, forming a multinational ecumenical organization, constituting a de facto supranational power untouched by governmental decisions. 52 But what ever dimensions or quantities this may have assumed today, capitalism has from the beginning mobilized a force of deterritorialization infinitely sur passing the deterritorialization proper to the State. For since Paleolithic and Neolithic times, the State has been deterritorializing to the extent that it makes the earth an *object *of its higher unity, a forced aggregate of coexis tence, instead of the free play of territories among themselves and with the

0 454 D 7000 B.C.: APPARATUS OF CAPTURE lineages. But this is precisely the sense in which the State is termed "terri torial." Capitalism, on the other hand, is not at all territorial, even in its beginnings: its power of deterritorialization consists in taking as its object, not the earth, but "materialized labor," the commodity. And private prop erty is no longer ownership of the land or the soil, nor even of the means of production as such, but of convertible abstract rights. 53 That is why capital ism marks a mutation in worldwide or ecumenical organizations, which now take on a consistency of their own: the worldwide axiomatic, instead of resulting from heterogeneous social formations and their relations, for the most part distributes these formations, determines their relations, while organizing an international division of labor. From all these stand points, it could be said that capitalism develops an economic order that could do without the State. And in fact capitalism is not short on war cries against the State, not only in the name of the market, but by virtue of its superior deterritorialization. This, however, is only one very partial aspect of capital. If it is true that we are not using the word axiomatic as a simple metaphor, we must review what distinguishes an axiomatic from all manner of codes, overcodings, and recodings: the axiomatic deals directly with purely functional ele ments and relations whose nature is not specified, and which are immedi ately realized in highly varied domains simultaneously; codes, on the other hand, are relative to those domains and express specific relations between qualified elements that cannot be subsumed by a higher formal unity (overcoding) except by transcendence and in an indirect fashion. The  *immanent axiomatic *finds in the domains it moves through so many mod els, termed *models of realization. *It could similarly be said that capital as right, as a "qualitatively homogeneous and quantitatively commensurable element," is realized in sectors and means of production (or that "unified capital" is realized in "differentiated capital"). However, the different sec tors are not alone in serving as models of realization—*the States *do too. Each of them groups together and combines several sectors, according to its resources, population, wealth, industrial capacity, etc. Thus the States, in capitalism, are not canceled out but change form and take on a new meaning: models of realization for a worldwide axiomatic that exceeds them. But to exceed is not at all the same thing as doing without. We have already seen that capitalism proceeds by way of the State-form rather than the town-form; the basis for the fundamental mechanisms described by Marx (the colonial regime, the public debt, the modern tax system and indirect taxation, industrial protectionism, trade wars) may be laid in the towns, but the towns function as mechanisms of accumulation, accelera tion, and concentration only to the extent that they are appropriated by States. Recent events tend to confirm this principle from another angle.

0 7000 B.C.: APPARATUS OF CAPTURE □ 455 For example, NASA appeared ready to mobilize considerable capital for  interplanetary exploration, as though capitalism were riding a vector tak-  ing it to the moon; but following the USSR, which conceived of extraterres-  trial space as a belt that should circle the earth taken as the "object," the  American government cut off funds for exploration and returned capital in  this case to a more centered model. It is thus proper to State  deterrito-rialization to moderate the superior deterritorialization of capital  and to provide the latter with compensatory reterritorializations. More  generally, this extreme example aside, we must take into account a  "materialist" determination of the modern State or nation-state: a group of  producers in which labor and capital circulate freely, in other words, in  which the homogeneity and competition of capital is effectuated, in  principle without external obstacles. In order to be effectuated, capitalism  has always required there to be a new force and a new law of States, on the  level of the flow of labor as on the level of the flow of independent  capital. So States are not at all transcendent paradigms of an overcoding but immanent models of realization for an axiomatic of decoded flows. Once  again, our use of the word "axiomatic" is far from a metaphor; we find liter-  ally the same theoretical problems that are posed by the models in an axio-  matic repeated in relation to the State. For models of realization, though  varied, are supposed to be *isomorphic *with regard to the axiomatic they  effectuate; however, this isomorphy, concrete variations considered,  accommodates itself to the greatest of formal differences. Moreover, a sin-  gle axiomatic seems capable of encompassing polymorphic models, not  only when it is not yet "saturated," but with those models as integral ele-  ments of its saturation. 54 These "problems" become singularly political when we think of modern States. 1. Are not all modern States isomorphic in relation to the capitalist axi omatic, to the point that the difference between democratic, totalitarian,  liberal, and tyrannical States depends only on concrete variables, and on  the worldwide distribution of those variables, which always undergo even-  tual readjustments? Even the so-called socialist States are isomorphic, to  the extent that there is *only one world market, *the capitalist one. 2. Conversely, does not the world capitalist axiomatic tolerate a real polymorphy, or even a heteromorphy, of models, and for two reasons? On  the one hand, capital as a general relation of production can very easily  integrate concrete sectors or modes of production that are noncapitalist.  But on the other hand, and this is the main point, the bureaucratic socialist  States can themselves develop different modes of production that only  conjugate with capitalism to form a set whose "power" exceeds that of the  axiomatic itself (it will be necessary to try to determine the nature of this

A typology of modern States is thus coupled with a metaeconomics: it would be inaccurate to treat all States as "interchangeable" (even isomorphy does not have that consequence), but it would be no less inac curate to privilege a certain form of the State (forgetting that polymorphy establishes strict complementarities between the Western democracies and the colonial or neocolonial tyrannies that they install or support in other regions) or to equate the bureaucratic socialist States with the totali tarian capitalist States (neglecting the fact that the axiomatic can encom pass a real heteromorphy from which the higher power of the aggregate derives, even if it is for the worse). What is called a nation-state, in the most diverse forms, is precisely the State as a model of realization. And the birth of nations implies many arti fices: Not only are they constituted in an active struggle against the imper ial or evolved systems, the feudal systems, and the autonomous cities, but they crush their own "minorities," in other words, minoritarian phenom ena that could be termed "nationalitarian," which work from within and if need be turn to the old codes to find a greater degree of freedom. The con stituents of the nation are a land and a people: the "natal," which is not nec essarily innate, and the "popular," which is not necessarily pregiven. The problem of the nation is aggravated in the two extreme cases of a land with out a people and a people without a land. How can a people and a land be made, in other words, a nation—a refrain? The coldest and bloodiest means vie with upsurges of romanticism. The axiomatic is complex, and is not without passions. The natal or the land, as we have seen elsewhere, implies a certain deterritorialization of the territories (community land, imperial provinces, seigneurial domains, etc.), and the people, a decoding of the population. The nation is constituted on the basis of these flows and is inseparable from the modern State that gives consistency to the corre sponding land and people. It is the flow of naked labor that makes the peo ple, just as it is the flow of Capital that makes the land and its industrial base. In short, the nation is the very operation of a collective subjecti-fication, to which the modern State corresponds as a process of subjection. It is in the form of the nation-state, with all its possible variations, that the State becomes the model of realization for the capitalist axiomatic. This is not at all to say that nations are appearances or ideological phenomena; on the contrary, they are the passional and living forms in which the qualitative homogeneity and the quantitative competition of abstract capital are first realized. We distinguish *machinic enslavement *and *social subjection *as two sepa rate concepts. There is enslavement when human beings themselves are

But there is subjection when the higher unity constitutes the human being as a subject linked to a now exterior object, which can be an animal, a tool, or even a machine. The human being is no longer a compo nent of the machine but a worker, a user. He or she is subjected *to *the machine and no longer enslaved *by *the machine. This is not to say that the second regime is more human. But the first regime does seem to have a spe cial relation to the archaic imperial formation: human beings are not sub jects but pieces of a machine that overcodes the aggregate (this has been called "generalized slavery," as opposed to the private slavery of antiquity, or feudal serfdom). We believe that Lewis Mumford is right in designating the archaic empires megamachines, and in pointing out that, once again, it is not a question of a metaphor: "If a machine can be defined more or less in accord with the classic definition of Reuleaux, as a combination of resist ant parts, each specialized in function, operating under human control to transmit motion and to perform work, then the *human machine *was a real machine." 55 Of course, it was the modern State and capitalism that brought the triumph of machines, in particular of motorized machines (whereas the archaic State had simple machines at best); but what we are referring to now are *technical machines, *which are definable extrinsically. One is not enslaved by the technical machine but rather subjected to it. It would appear, then, that the modern State, through technological development, has substituted an increasingly powerful social subjection for machinic enslavement. Ancient slavery and feudal serfdom were already procedures of subjection. But the naked or "free" worker of capitalism takes subjection to its most radical expression, since the processes of subjectification no longer even enter into partial conjunctions that interrupt the flow. In effect, capital acts as the point of subjectification that constitutes all human beings as subjects; but some, the "capitalists," are subjects of enun ciation that form the private subjectivity of capital, while the others, the "proletarians," are subjects of the statement, subjected to the technical machines in which constant capital is effectuated. The wage regime can therefore take the subjection of human beings to an unprecedented point, and exhibit a singular cruelty, yet still be justified in its humanist cry: No, human beings are not machines, we don't treat them like machines, we cer tainly don't confuse variable capital and constant capital.. . Capitalism arises as a worldwide enterprise of subjectification by con stituting an axiomatic of decoded flows. Social subjection, as the correlate of subjectification, appears much more in the axiomatic's models of real ization than in the axiomatic itself. It is within the framework of the nation-State, or of national subjectivities, that processes of subjectifica

The axiomatic itself, of which the States are models of realization, restores or reinvents, in new and now technical forms, an entire system of machinic enslavement. This in no way represents a return to the imperial machine since we are now in the immanence of an axiomatic, and not under the transcendence of a formal Unity. But it is the reinvention of a machine of which human beings are constituent parts, instead of subjected workers or users. If motorized machines constituted the second age of the technical machine, cybernetic and informational machines form a third age that reconstructs a gener alized regime of subjection: recurrent and reversible "humans-machines systems" replace the old nonrecurrent and nonreversible relations of sub jection between the two elements; the relation between human and machine is based on internal, mutual communication, and no longer on usage or action. 56 In the organic composition of capital, variable capital defines a regime of subjection of the worker (human surplus value), the principal framework of which is the business or factory. But with automa tion comes a progressive increase in the proportion of constant capital; we then see a new kind of enslavement: at the same time the work regime changes, surplus value becomes machinic, and the framework expands to all of society. It could also be said that a small amount of subjectification took us away from machinic enslavement, but a large amount brings us back to it. Attention has recently been focused on the fact that modern power is not at all reducible to the classical alternative "repression or ideol ogy" but implies processes of normalization, modulation, modeling, and information that bear on language, perception, desire, movement, etc., and which proceed by way of microassemblages. This aggregate includes both subjection and enslavement taken to extremes, as two simultaneous parts that constantly reinforce and nourish each other. For example, one is subjected to TV insofar as one uses and consumes it, in the very particular situation of a subject of the statement that more or less mistakes itself for a subject of enunciation ("you, dear television viewers, who make TV what it is . . ."); the technical machine is the medium between two subjects. But one is enslaved by TV as a human machine insofar as the television viewers are no longer consumers or users, nor even subjects who supposedly "make" it, but intrinsic component pieces, "input" and "output," feedback or recurrences that are no longer connected to the machine in such a way as to produce or use it. In machinic enslavement, there is nothing but trans formations and exchanges of information, some of which are mechanical, others human. 57 The term "subjection," of course, should not be confined to the national aspect, with enslavement seen as international or world wide. For information technology is also the property of the States that set themselves up as humans-machines systems. But this is so precisely to the

Social subjection proportions itself to the model of realization, just as machinic enslavement expands to meet the dimensions of the axiomatic that is effectuated in the model. We have the privilege of undergoing the two operations simultaneously, in relation to the same things and the same events. Rather than stages, subjection and enslavement constitute two coexistent poles. We may return to the different forms of the State, from the standpoint of a universal history. We distinguish three major forms: (1) imperial archaic States, which are paradigms and constitute a machine of enslavement by overcoding already-coded flows (these States have little diversity, due to a certain formal immutability that applies to all of them); (2) extremely diverse States—evolved empires, autonomous cities, feudal systems, monarchies—which proceed instead by subjectification and subjection, and constitute qualified or topical conjunctions of decoded flows; 3) the modern nation-States, which take decoding even further and are models of realization for an axiomatic or a general conjugation of flows (these States combine social subjection and the new machinic enslavement, and their very diversity is a function of isomorphy, of the eventual heteromorphy or polymorphy of the models in relation to the axiomatic). There are, of course, all kinds of external circumstances that mark pro found breaks between these types of States, and above all submit the archaic empires to utter oblivion, a shrouding lifted only by archaeology. The empires disappeared suddenly, as though in an instantaneous catas trophe. As in the Dorian invasion, a war machine looms up and bears down from without, killing memory. Yet things proceed quite differently on the inside, where all the States resonate together, appropriate armies for them selves, and exhibit a unity of composition in spite of their differences in organization and development. It is evident that all decoded flows, of whatever kind, are prone to forming a war machine directed against the State. But everything changes depending on whether these flows connect up with a war machine or, on the contrary, enter into conjunctions or a gen eral conjugation that appropriates them for the State. From this stand point, the modern States have a kind of transspatiotemporal unity with the archaic State. The internal correlation between 1 and 2 appears most clearly in the fact that the fragmented forms of the Aegean world presup pose the great imperial form of the Orient and find in it a stock or agricul tural surplus, which they consequently have no need to produce or accumulate for themselves. And to the extent that the States of the second age are nevertheless obliged to reconstitute a stock, if only because of exter nal circumstances—what State can do without one?—in so doing they

We find the revival of this form in the Greek, Roman, and feudal worlds: there is always an empire on the horizon, which for the subjective States plays the role of signifier and encompassing element. And the correlation between 2 and 3 is no less pro nounced, for industrial revolutions are not wanting, and the difference between topical conjunctions and the great conjugation of decoded flows is so thin that one is left with the impression that capitalism was continually being born, disappearing and reviving at every crossroads of history. And the correlation between 3 and 1 is also a necessary one: the modern States of the third age do indeed restore the most absolute of empires, a new "megamachine," whatever the novelty or timeliness of its now immanent form; they do this by realizing an axiomatic that functions as much by machinic enslavement as by social subjection. Capitalism has reawakened the *Urstaat, *and given it new strength. 58 Not only, as Hegel said, does every State imply "the essential moments of its existence as a State," but there is a unique moment, in the sense of a coupling of forces, and this moment of the State is capture, bond, knot,  *nexum, *magical capture. Must we speak of a second pole, which would operate instead by pact and contract? Is this not instead that other force, with capture as the unique moment of coupling? For the two forces are the overcoding of coded flows, and the treatment of decoded flows. The con tract is a juridical expression of the second aspect: it appears as the pro ceeding of subjectification, the outcome of which is subjection. And the contract must be pushed to the extreme; in other words, it is no longer con cluded between two people but between self and self, within the same person—*Ich = Ich*—as subjected and sovereign. The extreme perversion of the contract, reinstating the purest of knots. The knot, bond, capture, thus travel a long history: first, the objective, imperial collective bond; then all of the forms of subjective personal bonds; finally, the Subject that binds itself, and in so doing renews the most magical operation, "a cosmopolitan, universal energy which overflows every restriction and bond so as to estab lish itself instead as the sole bond." 59 Even subjection is only a relay for the fundamental moment of the State, namely, civil capture or machinic enslavement. The State is assuredly not the locus of liberty, nor the agent of a forced servitude or war capture. Should we then speak of "voluntary ser vitude"? This is like the expression "magical capture": its only merit is to underline the apparent mystery. There is a machinic enslavement, about which it could be said in each case that it presupposes itself, that it appears as preaccomplished; this machinic enslavement is no more "voluntary" than it is "forced."

0 7000 B.C.: APPARATUS OF CAPTURE □ 461 Politics is by no means an apodictic science. It proceeds by experimen tation, groping in the dark, injection, withdrawal, advances, retreats. The factors of decision and prediction are limited. It is an absurdity to postu late a world supergovernment that makes the final decisions. No one is even capable of predicting the growth in the money supply. Similarly, the States are affected by all kinds of coefficients of uncertainty and unpredict ability. John Kenneth Galbraith and Francois Chatelet have formulated the concept of constant and decisive errors, which make the glory of men of State no less than their rare successful evaluations. But that is just one more reason to make a connection between politics and axiomatics. For in science an axiomatic is not at all a transcendent, autonomous, and decision-making power opposed to experimentation and intuition. On the one hand, it has its own gropings in the dark, experimentations, modes of intuition. Axioms being independent of each other, can they be added, and up to what point (a saturated system)? Can they be withdrawn (a "weak ened" system)? On the other hand, it is of the nature of axiomatics to come up against *so-called undecidable propositions, *to confront *necessarily  higher powers *that it cannot master. 60 Finally, axiomatics does not consti tute the cutting edge of science; it is much more a stopping point, a reorder ing that prevents decoded semiotic flows in physics and mathematics from escaping in all directions. The great axiomaticians are the men of State of science, who seal off the lines of flight that are so frequent in mathematics, who would impose a new *nexum, *if only a temporary one, and who lay down the official policies of science. They are the heirs of the theorematic conception of geometry. When intuitionism opposed axiomatics, it was not only in the name of intuition, of construction and creation, but also in the name of a calculus of problems, a problematic conception of science that was not less abstract but implied an entirely different abstract machine, one working in the undecidable and the fugitive. 61 It is the real characteristics of axiomatics that lead us to say that capitalism and pres ent-day politics are an axiomatic in the literal sense. But it is precisely for this reason that nothing is played out in advance. From this standpoint, we may present a summary sketch of the "givens." 1. *Addition, subtraction. *The axioms of capitalism are obviously not theoretical propositions, or ideological formulas, but operative statements that constitute the semiological form of Capital and that enter as compo nent parts into assemblages of production, circulation, and consumption. The axioms are primary statements, which do not derive from or depend upon another statement. In this sense, a flow can be the object of one or several axioms (with the set of all axioms constituting the conjugation of the flows); but it can also lack any axioms of its own, its treatment being

There is a tendency within capitalism continually to add more axi oms. After the end of World War I, the joint influence of the world depres sion and the Russian Revolution forced capitalism to multiply its axioms, to invent new ones dealing with the working class, employment, union organization, social institutions, the role of the State, the foreign and domestic markets. Keynesian economics and the New Deal were axiom laboratories. Examples of the creation of new axioms after the Second World War: the Marshall Plan, forms of assistance and lending, transfor mations in the monetary system. It is not only in periods of expansion or recovery that axioms multiply. What makes the axiomatic vary, in relation to the States, is the distinction and relation between the foreign and domes tic markets. There is a multiplication of axioms most notably when an inte grated domestic market is being organized to meet the requirements of the foreign market. Axioms for the young, for the old, for women, etc. A very general pole of the State, "social democracy," can be defined by this ten dency to add, invent axioms in relation to spheres of investment and sources of profit: the question is not that of freedom and constraint, nor of centralism and decentralization, but of the manner in which one masters the flows. In this case, they are mastered by the multiplication of directing axioms. The opposite tendency is no less a part of capitalism: the tendency to withdraw, subtract axioms. One falls back on a very small number of axi oms regulating the dominant flows, while the other flows are given a deriv ative, consequential status (defined by the "theorems" ensuing from the axioms), or are left in an untamed state that does not preclude the brutal intervention of State power, quite the contrary. The "totalitarianism" pole of the State incarnates this tendency to restrict the number of axioms, and operates by the exclusive promotion of the foreign sector: the appeal to for eign sources of capital, the rise of industries aimed at the exportation of foodstuffs or raw materials, the collapse of the domestic market. The totali tarian State iS not a maximum State but rather, following Virilio's formula tion, the *minimum State of *anarcho-capitalism (cf. Chile). At the limit, the only axioms that are retained concern the equilibrium of the foreign sector, reserve levels and the inflation rate; "the population is no longer a given, it has become a consequence." As for untamed evolutions, they appear among other places in the variations in the employment level, in the phe nomena of exodus from the countryside, shantytown-urbanization, etc. The case of fascism ("national socialism") is distinct from totalitarian ism. It coincides with the totalitarian pole in the collapse of the domestic market and the reduction in the number of axioms. However, the promo tion of the foreign sector does not at all take place through an appeal to for

As for the domestic market, it is effec tuated in a specific production of the *Ersatz. *This means that fascism, too, brings a proliferation of axioms, which explains why it has often been com pared to a Keynesian economy. Fascism, however, is a tautological or ficti tious proliferation, a multiplication by subtraction; this makes it a very special case. 62 *2\. Saturation. *Can we express the distribution of the two opposite ten dencies by saying that the saturation of the system marks the point of inver sion? No, for the saturation is itself relative. If Marx demonstrated the functioning of capitalism as an axiomatic, it was above all in the famous chapter on the tendency of the rate of profit to fall. Capitalism is indeed an axiomatic, because it has no laws but immanent ones. It would like for us to believe that it confronts the limits of the Universe, the extreme limit of resources and energy. But all it confronts are its own limits (the periodic depreciation of existing capital); all it repels or displaces are its own limits (the formation of new capital, in new industries with a high profit rate). This is the history of oil and nuclear power. And it does both at once: capi talism confronts its own limits and simultaneously displaces them, setting them down again farther along. It could be said that the totalitarian ten dency to restrict the number of axioms corresponds to the confrontation with the limits, whereas the social democratic tendency corresponds to the displacement of the limits. But one does not come without the other, either in two different but coexistent places or in two successive but closely linked moments; they always have a hold on each other, or are even contained in each other, constituting the same axiomatic. A typical example would be present-day Brazil, with its ambiguous alternative "totalitarianism-social democracy." As a general rule, the limits are all the more mobile if axioms are subtracted in one place but added elsewhere. It would be an error to take a disinterested stance toward struggle on the level of the axioms. It is sometimes thought that every axiom, in capitalism or in one of its States, constitutes a "recuperation." But this disenchanted concept is not a good one. The constant readjustments of the capitalist axi omatic, in other words, the additions (the enunciation of new axioms) and the withdrawals (the creation of exclusive axioms), are the object of strug gles in no way confined to the technocracy. Everywhere, the workers' strug gles overspill the framework of the capitalist enterprises, which imply for the most part derivative propositions. The struggles bear directly upon the axioms that presi de over the State's public spending, or that even concern a specific international organization (for example, a multinational corpora

The resulting danger of a worldwide labor bureaucracy or technocracy taking charge of these problems can be warded off only to the extent that local struggles directly target national and international axioms, at the precise point of their insertion in the field of immanence (the potential of the rural world in this respect). There is always a fundamental difference between living flows and the axioms that subordinate them to centers of control and decision making, that make a given segment correspond to them, which measure their quanta. But the pressure of the living flows, and of the prob lems they pose and impose, must be exerted inside the axiomatic, as much in order to fight the totalitarian reductions as to anticipate and precipitate the additions, to orient them and prevent their technocratic perversion. 3. *Models, isomorphy. *In principle, all States are isomorphic; in other words, they are domains of realization of capital as a function of a sole external world market. But the first question is whether isomorphy implies a homogeneity or even a homogenization of States. The answer is yes, as can be seen in present-day Europe with respect to justice and the police, the highway code, the circulation of commodities, production costs, etc. But this is true only insofar as there is a tendency toward a single integrated domestic market. Otherwise, isomorphy in no way implies homogeneity: there is isomorphy, but heterogeneity, between totalitarian and social dem ocratic States wherever the mode of production is the same. The general rules regarding this are as follows: the consistency, *the totality {Vensemble),  or unity of the axiomatic *are defined by capital as a "right" or relation of production (for the market); *the respective independence of the axioms *in no way contradicts this totality but derives from the divisions or sectors of the capitalist mode of production; *the isomorphy of the models, *with the two poles of addition and subtraction, depends on how the domestic and foreign markets are distributed in each case. But this is only a first bipolarity, applying to the States that are located at the center and are under the capitalist mode of production. A second, West-East, bipolarity has been imposed on the States of the center, that of the capitalist States and the bureaucratic socialist States. Although this new distinction may share certain traits of the first (the so-called socialist States being assimilable to the totalitarian States), the problem lies else where. The numerous "convergence" theories that attempt to demonstrate a certain homogenization of the States of the East and West are not very convincing. Even isomorphism is not applicable: there is a real heteromorphy, not only because the mode of production is not capitalist, but also because the relation of production is not Capital (rather, it is the Plan). If the socialist States are nevertheless still models of realization for

It can even hap pen that the *socialist bureaucraticplan(e) *takes on a parasitic function in relation to the *plan(e) of capital, *which manifests a greater creativity, of the "virus" type. Finally, the third fundamental bipolarity is the center and the periphery (North-South). In view of the respective independence of the axioms, we can join Samir Amin in saying that the axioms of the periphery differ from those of the center. 63 And here again, the difference and independence of the axioms in no way compromise the consistency of the overall axiomatic. On the contrary, central capitalism needs the periphery constituted by the Third World, where it locates a large part of its most modern industries; it does not just invest capital in these industries, but is also furnished with capital by them. The issue of the dependence of the Third World States is of course an obvious one, but not the most important one (it was bequeathed by the old colonialism). It is obvious that having independent axioms has never guaranteed the independence of States; rather it ensures an interna tional division of labor. The important question, once again, is that of isomorphy in relation to the worldwide axiomatic. To a large extent, there is isomorphy between the United States and the bloodiest of the South American tyrannies (or between France, England, and West Germany and certain African States). The center-periphery bipolarity, States of the cen ter and States of the Third World, may well exhibit some of the distinguish ing traits of the two preceding bipolarities, but it also evades them, raising other problems. Throughout a vast portion of the Third World, the general relation of production is capital—even throughout the entire Third World, in the sense that the socialized sector may utilize that relation, adopting it in this case. But the mode of production is not necessarily capitalist, either in the so-called archaic or transitional forms, or in the most productive, highly industrialized sectors. This indeed represents a third case, included in the worldwide axiomatic: when capital acts as the relation of production but in noncapitalist modes of production. We may therefore speak of a polymorphy of the Third World States in relation to the States of the center. And this dimension of the axiomatic is no less necessary than the others; it is even much more necessary, for the heteromorphy of the so-called social ist States was imposed upon capitalism, which digested it as best it could, whereas the polymorphy of the Third World States is partially organized by the center, as an axiom providing a substitute for colonization. We are always brought back to the literal question of the models of real ization of a worldwide axiomatic: there is in principle an *isomorphy *of the States of the center, a *heteromorphy *imposed by the bureaucratic socialist

Once again, it would be absurd to think that the insertion of popular movements is con demned in advance throughout this field of immanence, and to assume that there are either "good" States that are democratic, social democratic or at the other extreme socialist, or that on the contrary all States are equiv alent and homogeneous. 4. *Power (puissance). *Let us suppose that the axiomatic necessarily mar shals a power higher than the one it treats, in other words, than that of the aggregates serving as its models. This is like a power of the continuum, tied to the axiomatic but exceeding it. We immediately recognize this power as a power of destruction, of war, a power incarnated in financial, industrial, and military technological complexes that are in continuity with one another. On the one hand, war clearly follows the same movement as capi talism: In the same way as the proportion of constant capital keeps grow ing, war becomes increasingly a "war of materiel" in which the human being no longer even represents a variable capital of subjection, but is instead a pure element of machinic enslavement. On the other hand, and this is the main point, the growing importance of constant capital in the axiomatic means that the depreciation of existing capital and the forma tion of new capital assume a rhythm and scale that necessarily take the route of a war machine now incarnated in the complexes: the complexes actively contribute to the redistributions of the world necessary for the exploitation of maritime and planetary resources. There is a continuous "threshold" of power that accompanies in every instance the shifting of the axiomatic's limits; it is as though the power of war always supersaturated the system's saturation, and was its necessary condition. The classical conflicts among the States of the center (as well as periph eral colonization) have been joined, or rather replaced, by two great conflictual lines, between West and East and North and South; these lines intersect and together cover everything. But the overarmament of the West and East not only leaves the reality of local wars entirely intact and gives them a new force and new stakes; it not only founds the "apocalyptic" pos sibility of a direct confrontation along the two great axes; it also seems that the war machine takes on a specific supplementary meaning: industrial, political, judicial, etc. It is indeed true that the States, throughout their his tory, have repeatedly appropriated the war machine; and it was after the war machine was appropriated that war, its preparation and effectuation, became the exclusive object of the machine, but as a more or less "limited" war. As for the aim, it remained the political aim of the States. The various factors that tended to make war a "total war," most notably the fascist fac tor, marked the beginning of an inversion of the movement: as though the

But  this unchained or liberated war machine continued to have as its object war  in action, a now total, unlimited kind of war. The entire fascist economy  became a war economy, but the war economy still needed total war as its  object. For this reason, fascist war still fell under Clausewitz's formula,  "the continuation of politics by other means," even though those other  means had become exclusive, in other words, the political aim had entered  into contradiction with the object (hence Virilio's idea that the fascist State  was a "suicidal" State more than a totalitarian one). It was only after World  War II that the automatization, then automation of the war machine had  their true effect. The war machine, the new antagonisms traversing it con-  sidered, no longer had war as its exclusive object but took in charge and as  its object peace, politics, the world order, in short, the aim. This is where  the inversion of Clausewitz's formula comes in: it is politics that becomes  the continuation of war; // *is peace that technologically frees the unlimited  material process of total war. *War ceases to be the materialization of the war  machine; *the war machine itself becomes materialized war. *In this sense,  there was no longer a need for fascism. The Fascists were only child precur-  sors, and the absolute peace of survival succeeded where total war had  failed. The Third World War was already upon us. The war machine  reigned over the entire axiomatic like the power of the continuum that sur-  rounded the "world-economy," and it put all the parts of the universe in  contact. The world became a smooth space again (sea, air, atmosphere),  over which reigned a single war machine, even when it opposed its own  parts. Wars had become a part of peace. More than that, the States no  longer appropriated the war machine; they reconstituted a war machine of  which they themselves were only the parts. Of all the authors who have developed an apocalyptic or millenarian sense, it is to Paul Virilio's credit to have emphasized these five rigorous  points: that the war machine finds its new object in the absolute peace of  terror or deterrence; that it performs a technoscientific "capitalization";  that this war machine is terrifying not as a function of a possible war that  it promises us, as by blackmail, but, on the contrary, as a function of the  real, very special kind of peace it promotes and has already installed; that  this war machine no longer needs a qualified enemy but, in conformity  with the requirements of an axiomatic, operates against the "unspecified  enemy," domestic or foreign (an individual, group, class, people, event,  world); that there arose from this a new conception of security as materia-  lized war, as organized insecurity or molecularized, distributed, pro-  grammed catastrophe. 64

This is expressed in a common thesis, taken up and developed by Valery Giscard d'Estaing: the more equilibrated things become at the center between the West and the East, beginning with the equilibrium of overarmament, the more they become disequilibrated or "destabilized" from North to South and destabilize the central equilibrium. It is clear that in these formulas the South is an abstract term designating the Third World or the periphery; and even that there are Souths or Third Worlds inside the center. It is also clear that this destabilization is not accidental but is a (theorematic) conse quence of the axioms of capitalism, principally of the axiom called *unequal  exchange, *which is indispensable to capitalism's functioning. This for mula is therefore the modern version of the oldest formula, which already obtained in the archaic empires under different conditions. The more the archaic empire overcoded the flows, the more it stimulated decoded flows that turned back against it and forced it to change. The more the decoded flows enter into a central axiomatic, the more they tend to escape to the periphery, to present problems that the axiomatic is incapable of resolving or controlling (even by adding special axioms for the periphery). The four principal flows that torment the representatives of the world economy, or of the axiomatic, are the flow of matter-energy, the flow of population, the flow of food, and the urban flow. The situation seems inex tricable because the axiomatic never ceases to create all of these problems, while at the same time its axioms, even multiplied, deny it the means of resolving them (for example, the circulation and distribution that would make it possible to feed the world). Even a social democracy adapted to the Third World surely does not undertake to integrate the whole poverty-stricken population into the domestic market; what it does, rather, is to effect the class rupture that will select the integratable elements. And the States of the center deal not only with the Third World, each of them has not only an external Third World, but there are internal Third Worlds that rise up within them and work them from the inside. It could even be said in certain respects that the periphery and the center exchange determinations: a deterritorialization of the center, a decoding of the center in relation to national and territorial aggregates, cause the peripheral formations to become true centers of investment, while the central formations

The more the worldwide axiomatic installs high industry and highly industrialized agriculture at the periphery, provisionally reserving for the center so-called postindustrial activities (automation, electronics, information technologies, the conquest of space, overarma-ment, etc.), the more it installs peripheral zones of underdevelopment inside the center, internal Third Worlds, internal Souths. "Masses" of the population are abandoned to erratic work (subcontracting, temporary work, or work in the underground economy), and their official subsistence is assured only by State allocations and wages subject to interruption. It is to the credit of thinkers like Antonio Negri to have formulated, on the basis of the exemplary case of Italy, the theory of this internal margin, which tends increasingly to merge the students with the *emarginati.* *66* * *These phenomena confirm the difference between the new machinic enslavement and classical subjection. For subjection remained centered on labor and involved a bipolar organization, property-labor, bourgeoisie-proletariat. In enslavement and the central dominance of constant capital, on the other hand, labor seems to have splintered in two directions: intensive surplus labor that no longer even takes the route of labor, and extensive labor that has become erratic and floating. The totalitarian tendency to abandon axioms of employment and the social democratic tendency to multiply statutes can combine here, but always in order to effect class ruptures. The opposition between the axiomatic and the flows it does not succeed in mastering becomes all the more accentuated. 6. *Minorities. *Ours is becoming the age of minorities. We have seen sev eral times that minorities are not necessarily defined by the smallness of their numbers but rather by becoming or a line of fluctuation, in other words, by the gap that separates them from this or that axiom constituting a redundant majority ("Ulysses, or today's average, urban European"; or as Yann Moulier says, "the national Worker, qualified, male and over thirty-five"). A minority can be small in number; but it can also be the largest in number, constitute an absolute, indefinite majority. That is the situation when authors, even those supposedly on the Left, repeat the great capitalist warning cry: in twenty years, "whites" will form only 12 percent of the world population. . . Thus they are not content to say that the majority will change, or has already changed, but say that it is impinged upon by a nondenumerable and proliferating minority that threatens to destroy the very concept of majority, in other words, the majority as an axiom. And the curious concept of nonwhite does not in fact constitute a denumerable set. What defines a minority, then, is not the number but the relations internal to the number. A minority can be numerous, or even infinite; so can a

What distinguishes them is that in the case of a majority the rela tion internal to the number constitutes a set that may be finite or infinite, but is always denumerable, whereas the minority is defined as a non denumerable set, however many elements it may have. What characterizes the nondenumerable is neither the set nor its elements; rather, it is the *con-  nection, *the "and" produced between elements, between sets, and which belongs to neither, which eludes them and constitutes a line of flight. The axiomatic manipulates only denumerable sets, even infinite ones, whereas the minorities constitute "fuzzy," nondenumerable, nonaxiomizable sets, in short, "masses," multiplicities of escape and flux. Whether it be the infinite set of the nonwhites of the periphery, or the restricted set of the Basques, Corsicans, etc., everywhere we look we see the conditions for a worldwide movement: the minorities recreate "nationali-tarian" phenomena that the nation-states had been charged with controlling and quashing. The bureaucratic socialist sector is certainly not spared by these movements, and as Amalrik said, the dissidents are nothing, or serve only as pawns in international politics, if they are abstracted from the minorities working the USSR. It matters little that the minorities are incapable of constituting viable States from the point of view of the axiomatic and the market, since in the long run they promote compositions that do not pass by way of the capitalist economy any more than they do the State-form. The response of the States, or of the axiomatic, may obviously be to accord the minorities regional or federal or statutory autonomy, in short, to add axioms. But this is not the problem: this operation consists only in translating the minorities into denumerable sets or subsets, which would enter as elements into the majority, which could be counted among the majority. The same applies for a status accorded to women, young people, erratic workers, etc. One could even imagine, in blood and crisis, a more radical reversal that would make the white world the periphery of a yellow world; there would doubtless be an entirely different axiomatic. But what we are talking about is something else, something even that would not resolve: women, nonmen, as a minority, as a nondenumerable flow or set, would receive no adequate expression by becoming elements of the majority, in other words, by becoming a denumerable finite set. Nonwhites would receive no adequate expression by becoming a new yellow or black majority, an infinite denumerable set. What is proper to the minority is to assert a power of the nondenumerable, even if that minority is composed of a single member. That is the formula for multiplicities. Minority as a universal figure, or becoming-everybody/everything *(devenir tout le monde). *Woman: we all have to become that, whether we are male or female. Non-white: we all have to become that, whether we are white, yellow, or black. Once again, this is not to say that the struggle on the level of the axioms is

But there is also always a sign to indicate that these struggles are the index of another, coexistent combat. However modest the demand, it always constitutes a point that the axiomatic cannot tolerate: when people demand to formu late their problems themselves, and to determine at least the particular conditions under which they can receive a more general solution (hold to the *Particular *as an innovative form). It is always astounding to see the same story repeated: the modesty of the minorities' initial demands, cou pled with the impotence of the axiomatic to resolve the slightest corre sponding problem. In short, the struggle around axioms is most important when it manifests, itself opens, the gap between two types of propositions, propositions of flow and propositions of axioms. The power of the minori ties is not measured by their capacity to enter and make themselves felt within the majority system, nor even to reverse the necessarily tautolog ical criterion of the majority, but to bring to bear the force of the non-denumerable sets, however small they may be, against the denumerable sets, even if they are infinite, reversed, or changed, even they if imply new axioms or, beyond that, a new axiomatic. The issue is not at all anarchy versus organization, nor even centralism versus decentralization, but a calculus or conception of the problems of nondenumerable sets, against the axiomatic of denumerable sets. Such a calculus may have its own compositions, organizations, even centralizations; nevertheless, it proceeds not via the States or the axiomatic process but via a pure becoming of minorities. 7. *Undecidablepropositions. *It will be objected that the axiomatic itself marshals the power of a nondenumerable infinite set: precisely that of the war machine. It seems difficult, however, to use the war machine in the gen eral "treatment" of minorities without triggering the absolute war it is sup posed to ward off. We have seen the war machine institute quantitative and qualitative processes, miniaturizations, and adaptations that enable it to graduate its attacks or counterattacks, each time as a function of the nature of the "unspecified enemy" (individuals, groups, peoples.. .). But under these conditions, the capitalist axiomatic continually produces and repro duces what the war machine tries to exterminate. Even the organization of famine multiplies the starving as much as it kills them. Even the organiza tion of *camps, *an area where the socialist sector has dreadfully distin guished itself, does not assure the radical solution of which power dreams. The extermination of a minority engenders a minority of that minority.

0 472 □ 7000 B.C.: APPARATUS OF CAPTURE However relentless the killing, it is relatively difficult to liquidate a people or a group, even in the Third World, once it has enough connections with elements of the axiomatic. In still other respects, it can be predicted that the impending problems of the economy, which will consist in reforming capital in relation to new resources (undersea oil, metallic nodules, food stuffs), will require not only a redistribution of the world that will mobilize the worldwide war machine and train its parts on the new objectives; we will also probably see the formation or re-formation of minoritarian aggre gates, in relation to the affected regions. Generally speaking, minorities do not receive a better solution of their problem by integration, even with axioms, statutes, autonomies, inde pendences. Their tactics necessarily go that route. But if they are revolu tionary, it is because they carry within them a deeper movement that challenges the worldwide axiomatic. The power of minority, of particu larity, finds its figure or its universal consciousness in the proletariat. But as long as the working class defines itself by an acquired status, or even by a theoretically conquered State, it appears only as "capital," a part of cap ital (variable capital), and does not leave the *plan(e) of capital. *At best, the plan(e) becomes bureaucratic. On the other hand, it is by leaving the plan(e) of capital, and never ceasing to leave it, that a mass becomes increasingly revolutionary and destroys the dominant equilibrium of the denumerable sets. 67 It is hard to see what an Amazon-State would be, a women's State, or a State of erratic workers, a State of the "refusal" of work. If minorities do not constitute viable States culturally, politically, economically, it is because the State-form is not appropriate to them, nor the axiomatic of capital, nor the corresponding culture. We have often seen capitalism maintain and organize inviable States, according to its needs, and for the precise purpose of crushing minorities. The minorities issue is instead that of smashing capitalism, of redefining socialism, of constituting a war machine capable of countering the world war machine by other means. If the two solutions of extermination and integration hardly seem possi ble, it is due to the deepest law of capitalism: it continually sets and then repels its own limits, but in so doing gives rise to numerous flows in all directions that escape its axiomatic. *At the same time as capitalism is effec-  tuated in the denumerable sets serving as its models, it necessarily consti-  tutes nondenumerable sets that cut across and disrupt those models. *It does not effect the "conjugation" of the deterritorialized and decoded flows without those flows forging farther ahead; without their escaping both the axiomatic that conjugates them and the models that reterritorialize them; without their tending to enter into "connections" that delineate a new Land; without their constituting a war machine whose aim is neither the

This is not a dispersion or a fragmentation: we are instead back at *the opposition  between, on the one hand, a plane of consistency and, on the other, the plane  of organization and development of capital and the bureaucratic socialist  plane. *There is in each case a constructivism, a "diagrammatism," operat ing by the determination of the conditions of the problem and by transver sal links between problems: it opposes both the automation of the capitalist axioms and bureaucratic programming. From this standpoint, when we talk about "undecidable propositions," we are not referring to the uncer tainty of the results, which is necessarily a part of every system. We are referring, on the contrary, to the coexistence and inseparability of that which the system conjugates, and that which never ceases to escape it fol lowing lines of flight that are themselves connectable. The undecidable is the germ and locus par excellence of revolutionary decisions. Some people invoke the high technology of the world system of enslavement; but even, and especially, this machinic enslavement abounds in undecidable propositions and movements that, far from belonging to a domain of knowledge reserved for sworn specialists, provides so many weapons for the becoming of everybody/everything, becoming-radio, becoming-electronic, becoming-molecular.. , 68 Every struggle is a function of all of these undecidable propositions and constructs *revolutionary  connections *in opposition to the *conjugations of the axiomatic.*

No sooner do we note a sim-  ple opposition between the two kinds of space than we must indicate a  much more complex difference by virtue of which the successive terms of  the oppositions fail to coincide entirely. And no sooner have we done that  than we must remind ourselves that the two spaces in fact exist only in mix-  ture: smooth space is constantly being translated, transversed into a stri-  ated space; striated space is constantly being reversed, returned to a  smooth space.

But the de facto mixes do not preclude a de jure, or abstract, distinction between the two spaces. That there is such a distinction is what accounts for the fact that the two spaces do not communicate with each other in the same way: it is the de jure distinction that determines the forms assumed by a given de facto mix and the direction or meaning of the mix (is a smooth space cap tured, enveloped by a striated space, or does a striated space dissolve into a smooth space, allow a smooth space to develop?). This raises a number of simultaneous questions: the simple oppositions between the two spaces; the complex differences; the de facto mixes, and the passages from one to another; the principles of the mixture, which are not at all symmetrical, sometimes causing a passage from the smooth to the striated, sometimes from the striated to the smooth, according to entirely different move ments. We must therefore envision a certain number of models, which would be like various aspects of the two spaces and the relations between them. ***The Technological Model. ***A fabric presents in principle a certain number of characteristics that permit us to define it as a striated space. First, it is constituted by two kinds of parallel elements; in the simplest case, there are vertical and horizontal elements, and the two intertwine, intersect perpen dicularly. Second, the two kinds of elements have different functions; one is fixed, the other mobile, passing above and beneath the fixed. Leroi-Gourhan has analyzed this particular figure of "supple solids" in basketry and weaving: stake and thread, warp and woof.' Third, a striated space of this kind is necessarily delimited, closed on at least one side: the fabric can be infinite in length but not in width, which is determined by the frame of the warp; the necessity of a back and forth motion implies a closed space (circular or cylindrical figures are themselves closed). Finally, a space of this kind seems necessarily to have a top and a bottom; even when the warp yarn and woof yarn are exactly the same in nature, number, and density, weaving reconstitutes a bottom by placing the knots on one side. Was it not these characteristics that enabled Plato to use the model of weaving as the paradigm for "royal science," in other words, the art of governing people or operating the State apparatus? Felt is a supple solid product that proceeds altogether differently, as an anti-fabric. It implies no separation of threads, no intertwining, only an entanglement of fibers obtained by fulling (for example, by rolling the block of fibers back and forth). What becomes entangled are the microscales of the fibers. An aggregate of intrication of this kind is in no way *homogeneous: *it is nevertheless smooth, and contrasts point by point with the space of fabric (it is in principle infinite, open, and unlimited in

Even the technologists who express grave doubts about the nomads' pow ers of innovation at least give them credit for felt: a splendid insulator, an ingenious invention, the raw material for tents, clothes, and armor among the Turco-Mongols. Of course, the nomads of Africa and the Maghreb instead treat wool as a fabric. Although it might entail displacing the oppo sition, do we not detect two very different conceptions or even practices of weaving, the distinction between which would be something like the dis tinction between fabric as a whole and felt? For among sedentaries, clothes-fabric and tapestry-fabric tend to annex the body and exterior space, respectively, to the immobile house: fabric integrates the body and the outside into a closed space. On the other hand, the weaving of the nomad indexes clothing and the house itself to the space of the outside, to the open smooth space in which the body moves. There are many interfacings, mixes between felt and fabric. Can we not displace the opposition yet again? In knitting, for example, the needles pro duce a striated space; one of them plays the role of the warp, the other of the woof, but by turns. Crochet, on the other hand, draws an open space in all directions, a space that is prolongable in all directions—but still has a cen ter. A more significant distinction would be between embroidery, with its central theme or motif, and patchwork, with its piece-by-piece construc tion, its infinite, successive additions of fabric. Of course, embroidery's variables and constants, fixed and mobile elements, may be of extraordi nary complexity. Patchwork, for its part, may display equivalents to themes, symmetries, and resonance that approximate it to embroidery. But the fact remains that its space is not at all constituted in the same way: there is no center; its basic motif ("block") is composed of a single element; the recurrence of this element frees uniquely rhythmic values distinct from the harmonies of embroidery (in particular, in "crazy" patchwork, which fits together pieces of varying size, shape, and color, and plays on the *tex-  ture *of the fabrics). "She had been working on it for fifteen years, carrying about with her a shapeless bag of dingy, threadbare brocade containing odds and ends of colored fabric in all possible shapes. She could never bring herself to trim them to any pattern; so she shifted and fitted and mused and fitted and shifted them like pieces of a patient puzzle-picture, trying to fit them to a pattern or create a pattern out of them without using her scissors, smoothing her colored scraps with flaccid, putty-colored fin gers." 2 An amorphous collection of juxtaposed pieces that can be joined together in an infinite number of ways: we see that patchwork is literally a Riemannian space, or vice versa.

The smooth space of patchwork is adequate to demonstrate that "smooth" does not mean homogeneous, quite the contrary: it is an *amorphous, *nonformal space prefiguring op art. The story of the quilt is particularly interesting in this connection. A quilt comprises two layers of fabric stitched together, often with a filler in between. Thus it is possible for there to be no top or bottom. If we follow the history of the quilt over a short migration sequence (the settlers who left Europe for the New World), we see that there is a shift from a formula dominated by embroidery (so-called "plain" quilts) to a patchwork for mula ("applique quilts," and above all "pieced quilts"). The first settlers of the seventeenth century brought with them plain quilts, embroidered and striated spaces of extreme beauty. But toward the end of the century patchwork technique was developed more and more, at first due to the scarcity of textiles (leftover fabric, pieces salvaged from used clothes, remnants taken from the "scrap bag"), and later due to the popularity of Indian chintz. It is as though a smooth space emanated, sprang from a striated space, but not without a correlation between the two, a recapitu lation of one in the other, a furtherance of one through the other. Yet the complex difference persists. Patchwork, in conformity with migration, whose degree of affinity with nomadism it shares, is not only named after trajectories, but "represents" trajectories, becomes inseparable from speed or movement in an open space. 3 ***The Musical Model. ***Pierre Boulez was the first to develop a set of simple oppositions and complex differences, as well as reciprocal nonsymmetrical correlations, between smooth and striated space. He created these con cepts and words in the field of music, defining them on several levels pre cisely in order to account for the abstract distinction at the same time as the concrete mixes. In the simplest terms, Boulez says that in a smooth space-time one occupies without counting, whereas in a striated space-time one counts in order to occupy. He makes palpable or perceptible the difference between nonmetric and metric multiplicities, directional and dimensional spaces. He renders them sonorous or musical. Undoubtedly, his personal work is composed of these relations, created or recreated musically. 4 At a second level, it can be said that space is susceptible to two kinds of breaks: one is defined by a standard, whereas the other is irregular and undetermined, and can be made wherever one wishes to place it. At yet another level, it can be said that frequencies can be distributed either in the intervals between breaks, or statistically without breaks. In the first case, the principle behind the distribution of breaks and intervals is called a "module"; it may be constant and fixed (a *straight *striated space), or

0 478 □ 1440: THE SMOOTH AND THE STRIATED regularly or irregularly variable *(curved *striated spaces, termed focalized if the variation of the module is regular, nonfocalized if it is irregular). When there is no module, the distribution of frequencies is without break: it is "statistical," however small the segment of space may be; it still has two aspects, however, depending on whether the distribution is equal (nondirected smooth space), or more or less rare or dense (directed smooth space). Can we say that in the kind of smooth space that is without break or module there is no interval? Or, on the contrary, has everything become interval, intermezzo? The smooth is a nomos, whereas the striated always has a logos, the octave, for example. Boulez is concerned with the commu nication between the two kinds of space, their alternations and superposi tions: how "a strongly directed smooth space tends to meld with a striated space," how "a striated space in which the statistical distribution of the pitches used is *in fact *equal tends to meld with a smooth space"; 5 how the octave can be replaced by "non-octave-forming scales" that reproduce themselves through a principle of spiraling; how "texture" can be crafted in such a way as to lose fixed and homogeneous values, becoming a support for slips in tempo, displacements of intervals, and *son art *transformations comparable to the transformations of *op art.* Returning to the simple opposition, the striated is that which inter twines fixed and variable elements, produces an order and succession of distinct forms, and organizes horizontal melodic lines and vertical har monic planes. The smooth is the continuous variation, continuous devel opment of form; it is the fusion of harmony and melody in favor of the production of properly rythmic values, the pure act of the drawing of a diagonal across the vertical and the horizontal. ***The Maritime Model. ***Of course, there are points, lines, and surfaces in striated space as well as in smooth space (there are also volumes, but we will leave this question aside for the time being). In striated space, lines or tra jectories tend to be subordinated to points: one goes from one point to another. In the smooth, it is the opposite: the points are subordinated to the trajectory. This was already the case among the nomads for the clothes-tent-space vector of the outside. The dwelling is subordinated to the journey; inside space conforms to outside space: tent, igloo, boat. There are stops and trajectories in both the smooth and the striated. But in smooth space, the stop follows from the trajectory; once again, the interval takes all, the interval is substance (forming the basis for rhythmic values). 6 In smooth space, the line is therefore a vector, a direction and not a dimension or metric determination. It is a space constructed by local oper ations involving changes in direction. These changes in direction may be due to the nature of the journey itself, as with the nomads of the archipela

Directed or not, and especially in the latter case, smooth space is directional rather than dimensional or metric. Smooth space is filled by events or haecceities, far more than by formed and perceived things. It is a space of affects, more than one of properties. It is *haptic *rather than optical perception. Whereas in the striated forms organize a matter, in the smooth materials signal forces and serve as symptoms for them. It is an intensive rather than extensive space, one of distances, not of measures and properties. Intense *Spatium *instead of *Extensio. *A Body without Organs instead of an organism and organization. Perception in it is based on symptoms and evaluations rather than measures and properties. That is why smooth space is occupied by intensities, wind and noise, forces, and sonorous and tactile qualities, as in the desert, steppe, or ice. 7 The creaking of ice and the song of the sands. Striated space, on the contrary, is can opied by the sky as measure and by the measurable visual qualities deriv ing from it. This is where the very special problem of the sea enters in. For the sea is a smooth space par excellence, and yet was the first to encounter the demands of increasingly strict striation. The problem did not arise in prox imity to land. On the contrary, the striation of the sea was a result of naviga tion on the open water. Maritime space was striated as a function of two astronomical and geographical gains: *bearings, *obtained by a set of calcula tions based on exact observation of the stars and the sun; and *the map, * which intertwines meridians and parallels, longitudes and latitudes, plot ting regions known and unknown onto a grid (like a Mendeleyev table). Must we accept the Portuguese argument and assign 1440 as the turning point that marked the first decisive striation, and set the stage for the great discoveries? Rather, we will follow Pierre Chaunu when he speaks of an extended confrontation at sea between the smooth and the striated during the course of which the striated progressively took hold. 8 For before longi tude lines had been plotted, a very late development, there existed a com plex and empirical nomadic system of navigation based on the wind and noise, the colors and sounds of the seas; then came a directional, preastronomical or already astronomical, system of navigation employing only latitude, in which there was no possibility of "taking one's bearings," and which had only portolanos lacking "translatable generalization" instead of true maps; finally, improvements upon this primitive astronom ical navigation were made under the very special conditions of the lati tudes of the Indian Ocean, then of the elliptical circuits of the Atlantic (straight and curved spaces). 9 It is as if the sea were not only the archetype

0 480 □ 1440: THE SMOOTH AND THE STRIATED of all smooth spaces but the first to undergo a gradual striation gridding it in one place, then another, on this side and that. The commercial cities par ticipated in this striation, and were often innovators; but only the States were capable of carrying it to completion, of raising it to the global level of a "politics of science." 10 A *dimensionality *that subordinated *directionality, * or superimposed itself upon it, became increasingly entrenched. This is undoubtedly why the sea, the archetype of smooth space, was also the archetype of all striations of smooth space: the striation of the desert, the air, the stratosphere (prompting Virilio to speak of a "vertical coastline," as a change in direction). It was at sea that smooth space was first subjugated and a model found for the laying-out and imposition of striated space, a model later put to use elsewhere. This does not contradict Virilio's other hypothesis: in the aftermath of striation, the sea reimparts a kind of smooth space, occupied first by the "fleet in being," then by the per petual motion of the strategic submarine, which outflanks all gridding and invents a neonomadism in the service of a war machine still more disturb ing than the States, which reconstitute it at the limit of their striations. The sea, then the air and the stratosphere, become smooth spaces again, but, in the strangest of reversals, it is for the purpose of controlling striated space more completely. 11 The smooth always possesses a greater power of deterritorialization than the striated. When examining the new profes sions, or new classes even, how can one fail to mention the military techni cians who stare into screens night and day and live for long stretches in strategic submarines (in the future it will be on satellites), and the apoca lyptic eyes and ears they have fashioned for themselves, which can barely distinguish any more between a natural phenomenon, a swarm of locusts, and an "enemy" attack originating at any given point? All of this serves as a reminder that the smooth itself can be drawn and occupied by diabolical powers *of organization; *value judgments aside, this demonstrates above all that there exist two nonsymmetrical movements, one of which striates the smooth, and one of which reimparts smooth space on the basis of the stri ated. (Do not new smooth spaces, or holey spaces, arise as parries even in relation to the smooth space of a worldwide organization? Virilio invokes the beginnings of subterranean habitation in the "mineral layer," which can take on very diverse values.) Let us return to the simple opposition between the smooth and the stri ated since we are not yet at the point where we can consider the dis symmetrical and concrete mixes. The smooth and the striated are distinguished first of all by an inverse relation between the point and the line (in the case of the striated, the line is between two points, while in the smooth, the point is between two lines); and second, by the nature of the line (smooth-directional, open intervals; dimensional-striated, closed

1440: THE SMOOTH AND THE STRIATED □ 481 intervals). Finally, there is a third difference, concerning the surface or space. In striated space, one closes off a surface and "allocates" it according to determinate intervals, assigned breaks; in the smooth, one "distributes" oneself in an open space, according to frequencies and in the course of one's crossings *(logos *and *nomos).* I2 As simple as this opposition is, it is not easy to place it. We cannot content ourselves with establishing an immedi ate opposition between the smooth ground of the nomadic animal raiser and the striated land of the sedentary cultivator. It is evident that the peas ant, even the sedentary peasant, participates fully in the space of the wind, the space of tactile and sonorous qualities. When the ancient Greeks speak of the open space of the *nomos*—nondelimited, unpartitioned; the pre-urban countryside; mountainside, plateau, steppe—they oppose it not to cultivation, which may actually be part of it, but to the *polis, *the city, the town. When Ibn Khaldun speaks *oibadiya, *bedouinism, the term covers cultivators as well as nomadic animal raisers: he contrasts it to  *hadara, *or "city life." This clarification is certainly important, but it does not change much. For from the most ancient of times, from Neolithic and even Paleolithic times, *it is the town that invents agriculture: *it is through the actions of the town that the farmers and their striated space are superposed upon the cultivators operating in a still smooth space (the transhumant cultivator, half-sedentary or already completely sedentary). So on this level we reencounter the simple opposition we began by challenging, between farmers and nomads, striated land and smooth ground: but only after a detour through the town as a force of striation. Now not only the sea, desert, steppe, and air are the sites of a contest between the smooth and the striated, but the earth itself, depending on whether there is cultivation in nomos-space or agriculture in city-space. Must we not say the same of the city itself? In contrast to the sea, the city is the striated space par excellence; the sea is a smooth space fundamentally open to striation, and the city is the force of striation that reimparts smooth space, puts it back into operation everywhere, on earth and in the other elements, outside but also inside itself. The smooth spaces arising from the city are not only those of worldwide organization, but also of a counterattack combining the smooth and the holey and turning back against the town: sprawling, temporary, shifting shantytowns of nomads and cave dwellers, scrap metal and fabric, patchwork, to which the striations of money, work, or housing are no longer even relevant. An explosive misery secreted by the city, and corresponding to Thorn's mathematical formula: "retroactive smoothing." 13 Condensed force, the potential for counterattack? In each instance, then, the simple opposition "smooth-striated" gives rise to far more difficult complications, alternations, and superpositions. But these complications basically confirm the distinction, precisely

482 □ 1440: THE SMOOTH AND THE STRIATED because they bring dissymmetrical movements into play. For now, it suf fices to say that there are two kinds of voyage, distinguished by the respec tive role of the point, line, and space. Goethe travel and Kleist travel? French travel and English (or American) travel? Tree travel and rhizome travel? But nothing completely coincides, and everything intermingles, or crosses over. This is because the differences are not objective: it is possible to live striated on the deserts, steppes, or seas; it is possible to live smooth even in the cities, to be an urban nomad (for example, a stroll taken by Henry Miller in Clichy or Brooklyn is a nomadic transit in smooth space; he makes the city disgorge a patchwork, differentials of speed, delays and accelerations, changes in orientation, continuous variations ... The beat niks owe much to Miller, but they changed direction again, they put the space outside the cities to new use). Fitzgerald said it long ago: it is not a question of taking off for the South Seas, that is not what determines a voy age. There are not only strange voyages in the city but voyages in place: we are not thinking of drug users, whose experience is too ambiguous, but of true nomads. We can say of the nomads, following Toynbee's suggestion:  *they do not move. *They are nomads by dint of not moving, not migrating, of holding a smooth space that they refuse to leave, that they leave only in order to conquer and die. Voyage in place: that is the name of all intensities, even if they also develop in extension. To think is to voyage; earlier we tried to establish a theo-noological model of smooth and striated spaces. In short, what distinguishes the two kinds of voyages is neither a measurable quantity of movement, nor something that would be only in the mind, but the mode of spatialization, the manner of being in space, of being for space. Voyage smoothly or in striation, and think the same way... But there are always passages from one to the other, transformations of one within the other, reversals. In his film, *Kings of the Road, *Wenders intersects and superposes the paths of two characters; one of them takes a still educa tional, memorial, cultural, Goethean journey that is thoroughly striated, whereas the other has already conquered smooth space, and only experi ments, induces amnesia in the German "desert." But oddly enough, it is the former who opens space for himself and performs a kind of retroactive smoothing, whereas striae reform around the latter, closing his space again. Voyaging smoothly is a becoming, and a difficult, uncertain becoming at that. It is not a question of returning to preastronomical navigation, nor to the ancient nomads. The confrontation between the smooth and the stri ated, the passages, alternations and superpositions, are under way today, running in the most varied directions. *The Mathematical Model. *It was a decisive event when the mathematician Riemann uprooted the multiple from its predicate state and made it a

1440: THE SMOOTH AND THE STRIATED □ 483 noun, "multiplicity." It marked the end of dialectics and the beginning of a typology and topology of multiplicities. Each multiplicity was defined by *n * determinations; sometimes the determinations were independent of the situation, and sometimes they depended upon it. For example, the magni tude of a vertical line between two points can be compared to the magni tude of a horizontal line between two other points: it is clear that the multiplicity in this case is metric, that it allows itself to be striated, and that its determinations are magnitudes. On the other hand, two sounds of equal pitch and different intensity cannot be compared to two sounds of equal intensity and different pitch; in this case, two determinations can be com pared only "if one is a part of the other and if we restrict ourselves to the judgment that the latter is smaller than the former, without being able to say by how much." 14 Multiplicities of this second kind are not metric and allow themselves to be striated and measured only by indirect means, which they always resist. They are anexact yet rigorous. Meinong and Russell opposed the notion of *distance *to that of *magnitude.* 15 Distances are not, strictly speaking, indivisible: they can be divided precisely in cases where the situation of one determination makes it part of another. But unlike magnitudes, *they cannot divide without changing in nature each  time. *An intensity, for example, is not composed of addable and displace-able magnitudes: a temperature is not the sum of two smaller temperatures, a speed is not the sum of two smaller speeds. Since each intensity is itself a difference, it divides according to an order in which each term of the division differs in nature from the others. Distance is therefore a set of ordered differences, in other words, differences that are enveloped in one another in such a way that it is possible to judge which is larger or smaller, but not their exact magnitudes. For example, one can divide movement into the gallop, trot, and walk, but in such a way that what is divided changes in nature at each moment of the division, without any one of these moments entering into the composition of any other. Therefore these multiplicities of "distance" are inseparable from a process of continuous variation, whereas multiplicities of "magnitude" distribute constants and variables. That is why we consider Bergson to be of major importance (much more so than Husserl, or even Meinong or Russell) in the development of the the ory of multiplicities. Beginning in *Time and Free Will, *he presents dura tion as a type of multiplicity opposed to metric multiplicity or the multiplicity of magnitude. Duration is in no way indivisible, but is that which cannot be divided without changing in nature at each division (Achilles' running is not divided into steps, his steps do not compose it in the manner of magnitudes). 16 On the other hand, in a multiplicity such as homogeneous extension, the division can be carried as far as one likes

0 484 □ 1440: THE SMOOTH AND THE STRIATED without changing anything in the constant object; or the magnitudes can vary with no other result than an increase or a decrease in the amount of space they striate. Bergson thus brought to light "two very different kinds of multiplicity," one qualitative and fusional, continuous, the other numerical and homogeneous, discrete. It will be noted that *matter *goes back and forth between the two; sometimes it is already enveloped in quali tative multiplicity, sometimes already developed in a metric "schema" that draws it outside of itself. The confrontation between Bergson and Einstein on the topic of Relativity is incomprehensible if one fails to place it in the context of the basic theory of Riemannian multiplicities, as modi fied by Bergson. We have on numerous occasions encountered all kinds of differences between two types of multiplicities: metric and nonmetric; extensive and qualitative; centered and acentered; arborescent and rhizomatic; numeri cal and flat; dimensional and directional; of masses and of packs; of magni tude and of distance; of breaks and of frequency; *striated and smooth. *Not only is that which peoples a smooth space a multiplicity that changes in nature when it divides—such as tribes in the desert: constantly modified distances, packs that are always undergoing metamorphosis—but smooth space itself, desert, steppe, sea, or ice, is a multiplicity of this type, non-metric, acentered, directional, etc. Now it might be thought that the Number would belong exclusively to the *other multiplicities, *that it would accord them the scientific status nonmetric multiplicities lack. But this is only partially true. It is true that the number is the correlate of the metric: magnitudes can striate space only by reference to numbers, and conversely, numbers are used to express increasingly complex relations between magnitudes, thus giving rise to ideal spaces reinforcing the striation and making it coextensive with all of matter. There is therefore a correlation within metric multiplicities between geometry and arithmetic, geometry and algebra, which is constitutive of major science (the most profound authors in this respect are those who have seen that the number, even in its simplest forms, is exclusively cardinal in character, and the unit exclusively divisible). 17 It could be said on the other hand that nonmetric multiplicities or the multiplicities of smooth space pertain only to a minor geometry that is purely operative and qualitative, in which calculation is necessarily very limited, and the local operations of which are not even capable of general translatability or a homogeneous system of location. Yet this "inferiority" is only apparent; for the independence of this nearly illiterate, ametric geometry is what makes possible the independence of the number, the subsequent function of which is to measure magnitudes in striated space (or to striate). The number distributes itself in smooth space; it does not divide without changing nature each time, without changing units, each of which

0 1440: THE SMOOTH AND THE STRIATED □ 485 represents a distance and not a magnitude. The ordinal, directional, no madic, articulated number, the numbering number, pertains to smooth space, just as the numbered number pertains to striated space. So we may say of every multiplicity that it is already a number, and still a unit. But the number and the unit, and even the way in which the unit divides, are differ ent in each case. Minor science is continually enriching major science, communicating its intuitions to it, its way of proceeding, its itinerancy, its sense of and taste for matter, singularity, variation, intuitionist geometry and the numbering number. But so far we have only considered the first aspect of smooth and nonmetric multiplicities, as opposed to metric multiplicities: how the situ ation of one determination can make it part of another without our being able either to assign that situation an exact magnitude or common unit, or to discount it. This is the enveloping or enveloped character of smooth space. But there is a second, more important, aspect: when the situation of the two determinations precludes their comparison. As we know, this is the case for Riemannian spaces, or rather, Riemannian patches of space: "Riemann spaces are devoid of any kind of homogeneity. Each is charac terized by the form of the expression that defines the square of the distance between two infinitely proximate points.... It follows that two neighbor ing observers in a Riemann space can locate the points in their immediate vicinity but cannot locate their spaces in relation to each other without a new convention. Each vicinity is therefore like a shred of Euclidean space,  *but the linkage between one vicinity and the next is not defined and can be  effected in an infinite number of ways. Riemann space at its most general  thus presents itself as an amorphous collection of pieces that are juxtaposed  but not attached to each other." *It is possible to define this multiplicity without any reference to a metrical system, in terms of the conditions of frequency, or rather *accumulation, *of a set of vicinities; these conditions are entirely different from those determining metric spaces and their breaks (even though a relation between the two kinds of space necessarily results). 18 In short, if we follow Lautman's fine description, Riemannian space is pure patchwork. It has connections, or tactile relations. It has rhythmic values not found elsewhere, even though they can be translated into a metric space. Heterogeneous, in continuous variation, it is a smooth space, insofar as smooth space is amorphous and not homogeneous. We can thus define two positive characteristics of smooth space in general: when there are determinations that are part of one another and pertain to enveloped distances or ordered differences, independent of magnitude; when, independent of metrics, determinations arise that cannot be part of one another but are connected by processes of frequency or accumulation. These are the two aspects of the *nomos *of smooth space.

0 486 □ 1440: THE SMOOTH AND THE STRIATED We are always, however, brought back to a dissymmetrical necessity to cross from the smooth to the striated, and from the striated to the smooth. If it is true that itinerant geometry and the nomadic number of smooth spaces are a constant inspiration to royal science and striated space, con versely, the metrics of striated spaces *{metrori) *is indispensable for the translation of the strange data of a smooth multiplicity. Translating is not a simple act: it is not enough to substitute the space traversed for the move ment; a series of rich and complex operations is necessary (Bergson was the first to make this point). Neither is translating a secondary act. It is an oper ation that undoubtedly consists in subjugating, overcoding, *metricizing * smooth space, in neutralizing it, but also in giving it a milieu of propaga tion, extension, refraction, renewal, and impulse without which it would perhaps die of its own accord: like a mask without which it could neither breathe nor find a general form of expression. Major science has a perpet ual need for the inspiration of the minor; but the minor would be nothing if it did not confront and conform to the highest scientific requirements. Let us take just two examples of the richness and necessity of translations, which include as many opportunities for openings as risks of closure or stoppage: first, the complexity of the means by which one translates inten sities into extensive quantities, or more generally, multiplicities of dis tance into systems of magnitudes that measure and striate them (the role of logarithms in this connection); second, and more important, the delicacy and complexity of the means by which Riemannian patches of smooth space receive a Euclidean conjunction (the role of the parallelism of vectors in striating the infinitesimal). 19 The mode of connection proper to patches of Riemannian space ("accumulation") is not to be confused with the Euclidean conjunction of Riemann space ("parallelism"). Yet the two are linked and give each other impetus. Nothing is ever done with: smooth space allows itself to be striated, and striated space reimparts a smooth space, with potentially very different values, scope, and signs. Perhaps we must say that all progress is made by and in striated space, but all becoming occurs in smooth space. Is it possible to give a very general mathematical definition of smooth spaces? Benoit Mandelbrot's "fractals" seem to be on that path. Fractals are aggregates whose number of dimensions is fractional rather than whole, or else whole but with continuous variation in direction. An exam ple would be a line segment whose central third is replaced by the angle of an equilateral triangle; the operation is repeated for the four resulting seg ments, and so on ad infinitum, following a relation of similarity—such a segment would constitute an infinite line or curve with a dimension greater than one, but less than a surface (= 2). Similar results can be

The end result is a "curve"  composed of an infinite number of  angled points that preclude any tan-  gent being drawn to any of their  points.

The illus-  trator could not represent the infinity of holes  of decreasing size beyond the fourth degree, but  it is plain to see that this cube is in the end infi-  nitely hollow. Its total volume approaches zero,  while the total lateral surface of the hollowings  infinitely grows. This space has a dimension of  2.7268. It therefore lies between a surface (with  a dimension of 2) and a volume (with a dimen-  sion of 3).

This is roughly the case for the warp and the woof, harmony and melody, longitude and latitude. The more regular the intersection, the tighter the striation, the more homogeneous the space tends to become; it is for this reason that from the beginning homogeneity did not seem to us to be a characteristic of smooth space, but on the contrary, the extreme result of striation, or the limit-form of a space striated everywhere and in all directions. If the smooth and the homogeneous seem to communicate, it is only because when the striated attains its ideal of perfect homogeneity, it is apt to reimpart smooth space, by a movement that superposes itself upon that of the homogeneous but remains entirely different from it. In each model, the smooth actually seemed to pertain to a fundamental heterogeneity: felt or patchwork rather than weaving, rhythmic values rather than harmony-melody, Riemannian space rather than Euclidean space—a continuous variation that exceeds any distribution of constants and variables, the freeing of a line that does not pass between two points, the formation of a plane that does not proceed by parallel and perpendicular lines. The link between the homogeneous and the striated can be expressed in terms of an imaginary, elementary physics. (1) You begin by striating space with parallel *gravitational *verticals.

(4) You discover that gravity is a particular case of a uni versal *attraction *following straight lines or biunivocal relations between two bodies. (5) You define a general notion of *workas *a force-displacement relation in a certain direction. (6) You then have the physical basis for an increasingly perfect striated space, running not only vertically and hori zontally, but in every direction subordinated to points. It is not even necessary to invoke this Newtonian pseudophysics. The Greeks already went from a space striated vertically, top to bottom, to a centered space with reversible and symmetrical relations in all directions, in other words, striated in every direction in such a way as to constitute a homogeneity. There is no question that these are like two models of the State apparatus, the vertical apparatus of the empire and the isotropic apparatus of the city-state. 21 Geometry lies at the crossroads of a physics problem and an affair of the State. It is obvious that the striation thus constituted has its limits: they are reached not only when the infinite (either infinitely large or small) is brought in, but also when more than two bodies are considered ("the three-body problem"). Let us try to understand in the simplest terms how space escapes the limits of its striation. At one pole, it escapes them by  *declination, *in other words, by the smallest deviation, by the infinitely small deviation between a gravitational vertical and the arc of a circle to which the vertical is tangent. At the other pole, it escapes them by the *spiral  or vortex, *in other words, a figure in which all the points of space are simultaneously occupied according to laws of frequency or of accumulation, distribution; these laws are distinct from the so-called laminar distribution corresponding to the striation of parallels. From the smallest deviation to the vortex there is a valid and necessary relation of consequence: what stretches between them is precisely a smooth space whose element is declination and which is peopled by a spiral. Smooth space is constituted by the minimum angle, which deviates from the vertical, and by the vortex, which overspills striation. The strength of Michel Serres's book is that it demonstrates this link between the *clinamen * as a generative differential element, and the formation of vortices and turbulences insofar as they occupy an engendered smooth space; in fact, the atom of the ancients, from Democritus to Lucretius, was always inseparable from a hydraulics, or a generalized theory of swells and flows. The ancient atom is entirely misunderstood if it is overlooked that its essence is to course and flow. The theory of atomism is the basis for a strict correlation between Archimedean geometry (very different from the striated and homogeneous space of Euclid) and Democritean physics (very different from solid or lamellar matter). 22 The

Serres states what he considers to be Lucretius's deepest goal: to go from Mars to Venus, to place the war machine in the service of peace. 23 But this operation is not accomplished through the State apparatus; it expresses, on the contrary, an ultimate metamorphosis of the war machine, and occurs in smooth space. Earlier we encountered a distinction between "free action" in smooth space and "work" in striated space. During the nineteenth century a two fold elaboration was undertaken: of a physicoscientific concept of Work (weight-height, force-displacement), and of a socioeconomic concept of labor-power or abstract labor (a homogeneous abstract quantity applicable to all work, and susceptible to multiplication and division). There was a profound link between physics and sociology: society furnished an eco nomic standard of measure for work, and physics a "mechanical currency" for it. The wage regime had as its correlate a mechanics of force. Physics had never been more social, for in both cases it was a question of defining the constant mean value of a force of lift and pull exerted in the most uni form way possible by a standard-man. Impose the Work-model upon every activity, translate every act into possible or virtual work, discipline free action, or else (which amounts to the same thing) relegate it to "leisure," which exists only by reference to work. We now understand why the Work-model, in both its physical and social aspects, is a fundamental part of the State apparatus. Standard-man began as the man of *public works.* *2* ** * It was not in relation to pin manufacturing that the problems of abstract labor, the multiplication of its results, and the division of its operations were first formulated; it was in public construction and in the organization of armies (not only the disciplining of men, but also the industrial production of weapons). Nothing more normal. The war machine in itself did not imply this normalization. But the State apparatus, in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, found a new way of appropriating the war machine: by subjugating it before all else to the Work-model of the construction site and factory, which were in the process of developing elsewhere, but more slowly. The war machine was perhaps the first thing to be striated, to produce an abstract labor-time whose results could be multiplied and operations divided. That is where free action in smooth space must have been conquered. The physicosocial model of Work pertains to the State apparatus, it is one of its inventions, and for two reasons. First, because labor appears only with the constitution *of a  surplus, *there is no labor that is not devoted to *stockpiling; *in fact, labor (in the strict sense) begins only with what is called *surplus labor. *Second, labor performs a generalized opera

Counterdemonstration: where there is no State and no surplus labor, there is no Work-model either. Instead, there is the continuous variation of free action, passing from speech to action, from a given action to another, from action to song, from song to speech, from speech to enterprise, all in a strange chromaticism with intense but rare peak moments or moments of effort that the outside observer can only "translate" in terms of work. It is true that it has been said of blacks through the ages that "they don't work, they don't know what work is." It is true that they were forced to work, and to work more than anyone else, in terms of abstract quantity. It also seems to be true that the Indians had no understanding of, and were unsuited for, any organization of work, even slavery: the Americans apparently imported so many blacks only because they could not use the Indians, who would rather die. Certain outstanding ethnologists have raised an essential question. They have turned the problem around: so-called primitive socie ties are not societies of shortage or subsistence due to an absence of work, but on the contrary are societies of free action and smooth space that have no use for a work-factor, anymore than they constitute a stock. 25 They are not societies of sloth, even though their differences with work may be expressed in the form of a "right to laziness." They are not without laws, even though their differences with the law may be expressed in the guise of "anarchy." What they have instead is a law of the nomos regulating a con tinuous variation of activity with a rigor and cruelty all its own (get rid of whatever cannot be transported, the old, children . . .). If work constitutes a striated space-time corresponding to the State apparatus, is this not especially true of its archaic or ancient forms? For it is there that surplus labor is isolated, distinguished, in the form of tribute or corvee. Consequently, it is there that the concept of labor appears at its clearest, for example, in the large-scale works of the empires, the urban, agricultural, or hydraulic works by which a "laminar" flow in supposedly parallel layers (striation) is imposed upon the waters. It seems on the con trary that in the capitalist regime, surplus labor becomes less and less dis tinguishable from labor "strictly speaking," and totally impregnates it. Modern public works have a different status from that of large-scale imper ial works. How could one possibly distinguish between the time necessary for reproduction and "extorted" time, when they are no longer separated in time? This remark certainly does not contradict the Marxist theory of sur plus value, for Marx shows precisely that surplus value *ceases to be  localizable *in the capitalist regime. That is even his fundamental contri bution. It gave him a sense that machines would themselves become

In these new conditions, it remains true that all labor involves surplus labor; but surplus labor no longer requires labor. Surplus labor, capitalist organization in its entirety, operates less and less by the striation of space-time corresponding to the physicosocial concept of work. Rather, it is as though human aliena tion through surplus labor were replaced by a generalized "machinic enslavement," such that one may furnish surplus-value without doing any work (children, the retired, the unemployed, television viewers, etc.). Not only does the user as such tend to become an employee, but capitalism operates less on a quantity of labor than by a complex qualitative process bringing into play modes of transportation, urban models, the media, the entertainment industries, ways of perceiving and feeling—every semiotic system. It is as though, at the outcome of the striation that capitalism was able to carry to an unequaled point of perfection, circulating capital neces sarily recreated, reconstituted, a sort of smooth space in which the destiny of human beings is recast. Striation, of course, survives in the most perfect and severest of forms (it is not only vertical but operates in all directions); however, it relates primarily to the state pole of capitalism, in other words, to the role of the modern State apparatuses in the organization of capital. On the other hand, at the complementary and dominant level of *integrated  (or rather integrating) world capitalism, *a new smooth space is produced in which capital reaches its "absolute" speed, based on machinic components rather than the human component of labor. The multinationals fabricate a kind of deterritorialized smooth space in which points of occupation as well as poles of exchange become quite independent of the classical paths to striation. What is really new are always the new forms of turnover. The present-day accelerated forms of the circulation of capital are making the distinctions between constant and variable capital, and even fixed and cir culating capital, increasingly relative; the essential thing is instead the dis tinction between *striated capital *and *smooth capital, *and the way in which the former gives rise to the latter through complexes that cut across terri tories and States, and even the different types of States. ***The Aesthetic Model: Nomad Art. ***Several notions, both practical and the oretical, are suitable for defining nomad art and its successors (barbarian, Gothic, and modern). First, "close-range" vision, as distinguished from long-distance vision; second, "tactile," or rather "haptic" space, as distin guished from optical space. "Haptic" is a better word than "tactile" since it does not establish an opposition between two sense organs but rather invites the assumption that the eye itself may fulfill this nonoptical func tion.

The Striated, on the contrary, relates to a more distant vision, and a more optical space— although the eye in turn is not the only organ to have this capacity. Once again, as always, this analysis must be corrected by a coefficient of transfor mation according to which passages between the striated and the smooth are at once necessary and uncertain, and all the more disruptive. The law of the painting is that it be done at close range, even if it is viewed from rela tively far away. One can back away from a thing, but it is a bad painter who backs away from the painting he or she is working on. Or from the "thing" for that matter: Cezanne spoke of the need to *no longer see *the wheat field, to be too close to it, to lose oneself without landmarks in smooth space. Afterward, striation can emerge: drawing, strata, the earth, "stubborn geometry," the "measure of the world," "geological foundations," "every thing falls straight down" . . . The striated itself may in turn disappear in a "catastrophe," opening the way for a new smooth space, and another stri ated space... A painting is done at close range, even if it is seen from a distance. Simi larly, it is said that composers do not hear: they have close-range hearing, whereas listeners hear from a distance. Even writers write with short-term memory, whereas readers are assumed to be endowed with long-term memory. The first aspect of the haptic, smooth space of close vision is that its orientations, landmarks, and linkages are in continuous variation; it operates step by step. Examples are the desert, steppe, ice, and sea, local spaces of pure connection. Contrary to what is sometimes said, one never sees from a distance in a space of this kind, nor does one see it from a dis tance; one is never "in front of," any more than one is "in" (one is "on" ...). Orientations are not constant but change according to temporary vegeta tion, occupations, and precipitation. There is no visual model for points of reference that would make them interchangeable and unite them in an inertial class assignable to an immobile outside observer. On the contrary, they are tied to any number of observers, who may be qualified as "mon ads" but are instead *nomads *entertaining tactile relations among them selves. The interlinkages do not imply an ambient space in which the multiplicity would be immersed and which would make distances invari ant; rather, they are constituted according to ordered differences that give rise to intrinsic variations in the division of a single distance. 27 These ques tions of orientation, location, and linkage enter into play in the most

This is an animality that can be seen only by touching it with one's mind, but without the mind becoming a finger, not even by way of the eye. (In a much cruder fashion, the kaleidoscope has exactly the same function: to give the eye a digital function.) Striated space, on the contrary, is defined by the require ments of long-distance vision: constancy of orientation, in variance of dis tance through an interchange of inertial points of reference, interlinkage by immersion in an ambient milieu, constitution of a central perspective. It is less easy to evaluate the creative potentialities of striated space, and how it can simultaneously emerge from the smooth and give everything a whole new impetus. The opposition between the striated and the smooth is not simply that of the global and the local. For in one case, the global is still relative, whereas in the other the local is already absolute. Where there is close vision, space is not visual, or rather the eye itself has a haptic, nonoptical function: no line separates earth from sky, which are of the same substance; there is nei ther horizon nor background nor perspective nor limit nor outline or form nor center; there is no intermediary distance, or all distance is intermedi ary. Like Eskimo space. 28 In a totally different way, in a totally different context, Arab architecture constitutes a space that begins very near and low, placing the light and the airy below and the solid and heavy above. This reversal of the laws of gravity turns *lack of direction *and negation of volume into constructive forces. There exists a nomadic absolute, as a local integration moving from part to part and constituting smooth space in an infinite succession of linkages and changes in direction. It is an absolute that is one with becoming itself, with process. It is the absolute of passage, which in nomad art merges with its manifestation. Here the absolute is local, precisely because place is not delimited. If we now turn to the striated and optical space of long-distance vision, we see that the relative global that characterizes that space also requires the absolute, but in an entirely different way. The absolute is now the horizon or background, in other words, the Encompassing Element without which nothing would be global or englobed. It is against this background that the relative outline or form appears. The absolute itself can appear in the Encompassed, but only in a privileged place well delimited as a center, which then functions to repel beyond the limits anything that menaces the global integration. We can see clearly here how smooth space subsists, but only to give rise to the striated.

0 1440: THE SMOOTH AND THE STRIATED □ 495 The desert, sky, or sea, the Ocean, the Unlimited, first plays the role of an encompassing element, and tends to become a horizon: the earth is thus surrounded, globalized, "grounded" by this element, which holds it in immobile equilibrium and makes Form possible. Then to the extent that the encompassing element itself appears at the center of the earth, it assumes a second role, that of casting into the loathesome deep, the abode of the dead, anything smooth or nonmeasured that may have remained. 29 The striation of the earth implies as its necessary condition this double treatment of the smooth: on the one hand, it is carried or reduced to the absolute state of an encompassing horizon, and on the other it is expelled from the relative encompassed element. Thus the great imperial religions need a smooth space like the desert, but only in order to give it a law that is opposed to the *nomos *in every way, and converts the absolute. This perhaps explains for us the ambiguity of the excellent analyses by Riegl, Worringer, and Maldiney. They approach haptic space under the imperial conditions of Egyptian art. They define it as the presence of a horizon-background; the reduction of space to the plane (vertical and hori zontal, height and width); and the rectilinear outline enclosing individual ity and withdrawing it from change. Like the pyramid-form, every side a plane surface, against the background of the immobile desert. On the other hand, they show how in Greek art (then in Byzantine art, and up to the Ren aissance), an optical space was differentiated from haptic space, one merg ing background with form, setting up an interference between the planes, conquering depth, working with cubic or voluminous extension, organiz ing perspective, and playing on relief and shadow, light and color. Thus at the very beginning they encounter the haptic at a point of mutation, in con ditions under which it already serves to striate space. The optical makes that striation tighter and more perfect, or rather tight and perfect in a dif ferent way (it is not associated with the same "artistic will"). Everything occurs in a striated space that goes from empires to city-states, or evolved empires. It is not by chance that Riegl tends to eliminate the specific fac tors of nomad or even barbarian art; or that Worringer, when he introduces the idea of Gothic art in the broadest sense, relates it on the one hand to the Germanic and Celtic migrations of the North, and on the other to the empires of the East. But between the two were the nomads, who are reduci ble neither to empires they confronted nor the migrations they triggered. The Goths themselves were nomads of the steppe, and with the Sarmatians and Huns were an essential vector of communication between the East and the North, a factor irreducible to either of these two dimensions. 30 On one side, Egypt had its Hyksos, Asia Minor its Hittites, China its Turco-Mongols; and on the other, the Hebrews had their Habiru, the Germans, Celts, and Romans their Goths, the Arabs their Bedouins.

Again, there is a refusal to accept that the intermediary between the East and the North had its own absolute specificity, that the intermediary, the interval, played exactly this substantial role. Moreover, it does not have that role in the guise of a "will"; it only has a becoming, it invents a "becoming-artist." When we invoke a primordial duality between the smooth and the stri ated, it is in order to subordinate the differences between "haptic" and "optic," "close vision" and "distant vision" to this distinction. Hence we will not define the haptic by the immobile background, by the plane and the contour, because these have to do with an already mixed state in which the haptic serves to striate, and uses its smooth components only in order to convert them to another kind of space. The haptic function and close vision presuppose the smooth, which has no background, plane, or con tour, but rather changes in direction and local linkages between parts. Con versely, the developed optical function is not content to take striation to a new level of perfection, endowing it with an imaginary universal value and scope; it is also capable of reinstating the smooth, liberating light and mod ulating color, restoring a kind of aerial haptic space that constitutes the unlimited site of intersection of the planes. 31 In short, the smooth and the striated must be defined in themselves before the relative distinctions between haptic and optical, near and distant, can be derived. This is where a third couple enters in: "abstract line-concrete line" (in addition to "haptic-optical," "close-distant"). It is Worringer who accorded fundamental importance to the abstract line, seeing it as the very beginning of art or the first expression of an artistic will. Art as abstract machine. Once again, it will doubtless be our inclination to voice in advance the same objections: for Worringer, the abstract line seems to make its first appearance in the crystalline or geometrical imperial Egyp tian form, the most rectilinear of forms possible. It is only afterward that it assumes a particular avatar, constituting the "Gothic or Northern line" understood very broadly. 32 For us, on the other hand, the abstract line is fundamentally "Gothic," or rather, nomadic, not rectilinear. Conse quently, we do not understand the aesthetic motivation for the abstract line in the same way, or its identity with the beginning of art. Whereas the recti linear (or "regularly" rounded) Egyptian line is negatively motivated by anxiety in the face of all that passes, flows, or varies, and erects the con stancy and eternity of an In-Itself, the nomad line is abstract in an entirely different sense, precisely because it has a multiple orientation and passes  *between *points, figures, and contours: it is positively motivated by the smooth space it draws, not by any striation it might perform to ward off

Further more, although it is true that art begins only with the abstract line, the rea son is not, as Worringer says, that the rectilinear is the first means of breaking with the nonaesthetic imitation of nature upon which the prehis toric, savage, and childish supposedly depend, lacking, as he thinks they do, a "will to art." On the contrary, if prehistoric art is fully art it is precisely because it manipulates the abstract, though nonrectilinear, line: "Primi tive art begins with the abstract, and even the prefigurative.... Art is abstract from the outset, and at its origin could not have been otherwise." 33 In effect, the line is all the more abstract when writing is absent, either because it has yet to develop or only exists outside or alongside. When writ ing takes charge of abstraction, as it does in empires, the line, already downgraded, necessarily tends to become concrete, even figurative. Chil dren forget how to draw. But in the absence of writing, or when peoples have no need for a writing system of their own because theirs is borrowed from more or less nearby empires (as was the case for the nomads), the line is necessarily abstract; it is necessarily invested with all the power of abstraction, which finds no other outlet. That is why we believe that the dif ferent major types of imperial lines—the Egyptian rectilinear line, the Assyrian (or Greek) organic line, the supraphenomenal, encompassing Chinese line—convert the abstract line, rend it from its smooth space, and accord it concrete values. Still, it can be argued that these imperial lines are contemporaneous with the abstract line; the abstract line is no less at the "beginning," inasmuch as it is a pole always presupposed by any line capa ble of constituting another pole. The abstract line is at the beginning as much because of its historical abstraction as its prehistoric dating. It is therefore a part of the originality or irreducibility of nomad art, even when there is reciprocal interaction, influence, and confrontation with the imperial lines of sedentary art. The abstract is not directly opposed to the figurative. The figurative as such is not inherent to any "will to art." In fact, we may oppose a figurative line in art to one that is not. The figurative, or imitation and representa tion, is a consequence, a result of certain characteristics of the line when it assumes a given form. We must therefore define those characteristics first. Take a system in which transversals are subordinated to diagonals, diago nals to horizontals and verticals, and horizontals and verticals to points (even when there are virtual). A system of this kind, which is rectilinear or unilinear regardless of the number of lines, expresses the formal conditions under which a space is striated and the line describes a contour. Such a line is inherently, formally, representative in itself, even if it does not represent anything. On the other hand, *a line that delimits nothing, that describes no*

0 498 D 1440: THE SMOOTH AND THE STRIATED *contour, *that no longer goes from one point to another but instead passes between points, that is always declining from the horizontal and the verti cal and deviating from the diagonal, that is constantly changing direction, a mutant line of this kind that is without outside or inside, form or back ground, beginning or end and that is as alive as a continuous variation— such a line is truly an abstract line, and describes a smooth space. It is not inexpressive. Yet is true that it does not constitute a stable and symmetrical  *form of expression *grounded in a resonance of points and a conjunction of lines. It is nevertheless accompanied by *material traits of expression, *the effects of which multiply step by step. This is what Worringer means when he says that the Gothic line (for us, the nomadic line invested with abstrac tion) has the power of expression and not of form, that it has repetition as a power, not symmetry as form. Indeed, it is through symmetry that rectilin ear systems limit repetition, preventing infinite progression and maintain ing the *organic *domination of a central point with radiating lines, as in reflected or star-shaped figures. It is free action, however, which by its essence unleashes the power of repetition as a *machinic *force that multi plies its effect and pursues an infinite movement. Free action proceeds by disjunction and decentering, or at least by peripheral movement: dis jointed polythetism instead of symmetrical antithetism. 34 Traits of expres sion describing a smooth space and connecting with a matter-flow thus should not be confused with striae that convert space and make it a form of expression that grids and organizes matter. Worringer's finest pages are those in which he contrasts the abstract with the organic. The organic does not designate something represented, but above all the form of representation, and even the feeling that unites representation with a subject *{Einfuhlung, *"empathy"). "Formal processes occur within the work of art which correspond to the natural organic ten dencies in man." 35 But the rectilinear, the geometrical, cannot be opposed to the organic in this sense. The Greek organic line, which subordinates volume and spatiality, takes over from the Egyptian geometrical line, which reduced them to the plane. The organic, with its symmetry and con tours inside and outside, still refers to the rectilinear coordinates of a stri ated space. The organic body is prolonged by straight lines that attach it to what lies in the distance. Hence the primacy of human beings, or of the face: We are this form of expression itself, simultaneously the supreme organism and the relation of all organisms to metric space in general. The abstract, on the contrary, begins only with what Worringer presents as the "Gothic" avatar. It is this nomadic line that he says is mechanical, but in free action and swirling; it is inorganic, yet alive, and all the more alive for being inorganic. It is distinguished both from the geometrical and the organic. It raises "mechanical" relations to the level of *intuition. *Heads

This stream ing, spiraling, zigzagging, snaking, feverish line of variation liberates a power of life that human beings had rectified and organisms had confined, and which matter now expresses as the trait, flow, or impulse traversing it. If everything is alive, it is not because everything is organic or organized but, on the contrary, because the organism is a diversion of life. In short, the life in question is inorganic, germinal, and intensive, a powerful life without organs, a Body that is all the more alive for having no organs, everything that passes *between *organisms ("once the natural barriers of organic movement have been overthrown, there are no more limits"). 36 Many authors have wished to establish a kind of duality in nomad art between the ornamental abstract line and animal motifs, or more subtly, between the speed with which the line integrates and carries expressive traits, and the slowness or fixity of the animal matter traversed, between a line of flight without beginning or end and an almost immobile swirling. But in the end everyone agrees that it is a question of a single will, or a single becoming. 37 This is not because the abstract engenders organic motifs, by chance or by association. Rather, it is precisely because pure animality is experienced as inorganic, or supraorganic, that it can combine so well with abstraction, and even combine the slowness or heaviness of a matter with the extreme speed of a line that has become entirely spiritual. The slowness belongs to the same world as the extreme speed: relations of speed and slowness between elements, which surpass in every way the movement of an organic form and the determination of organs. The line escapes geome try by a fugitive mobility at the same time as life tears itself free from the organic by a permutating, stationary whirlwind. This vital force specific to the Abstraction is what draws smooth space. The abstract line is the affect of smooth space, just as organic representation was the feeling presiding over striated space. The haptic-optical, near-distant distinctions must be subordinated to the distinction between the abstract line and the organic line; they must find their principle in a general confrontation of spaces. The abstract line cannot be defined as geometrical and rectilinear. What then should be termed *abstract *in modern art? A line of variable direction that describes no contour and delimits no form . . , 38 Do not multiply models. We are well aware that there are many others: a ludic model, which would compare games according to their type of space and found game theory on different principles (for example, the smooth space of Go versus the striated space of chess); and a noological model con cerned not with thought contents (ideology) but with the form, manner or mode, and function of thought, according to the mental space it draws and

Moreover, there are still other kinds of space that should be taken into account, for example, holey space and the way it communicates with the smooth and the striated in different ways. What interests us in operations of striation and smoothing are precisely the passages or combi nations: how the forces at work within space continually striate it, and how in the course of its striation it develops other forces and emits new smooth spaces. Even the most striated city gives rise to smooth spaces: to live in the city as a nomad, or as a cave dweller. Movements, speed and slowness, are sometimes enough to reconstruct a smooth space. Of course, smooth spaces are not in themselves liberatory. But the struggle is changed or dis placed in them, and life reconstitutes its stakes, confronts new obstacles, invents new paces, switches adversaries. Never believe that a smooth space will suffice to save us.

502 □ CONCLUSION: CONCRETE RULES AND ABSTRACT MACHINES S *Strata, stratification* The strata are phenomena of thickening on the Body of the earth, 3 simultaneously molecular and molar: accumulations, coagulations, sedimentations, foldings. They are Belts, Pincers, or Articulations. Summarily and traditionally, we distinguish three major strata: physicochemical, organic, and anthropomorphic (or "alloplastic"). Each stratum, or articulation, consists of coded milieus and formed substances. *Forms and substances, codes and milieus *are not really distinct. They are the abstract components of every articulation. A stratum obviously presents very diverse forms and substances, a variety of codes and milieus. It thus possesses both different formal Types of organization and different substantial Modes of develop ment, which divide it into *parastrata and epistrata, *for example, the divisions of the organic stratum. The epistrata and parastrata subdi viding a stratum can be considered strata themselves (so that the list is never exhaustive). A given stratum retains a unity of composition in spite of the diversity in its organization and development. The unity of composition relates to formal traits common to all of the forms or codes of a stratum, and to substantial elements, materials common to all of the stratum's substances or milieus. The strata are extremely mobile. One stratum is always capable of serving as the *substratum *of another, or of colliding with another, independently of any evolutionary order. Above all, be-ween two strata or between two stratic divisions, there are  *inter-stratic *phenomena: transcodings and passages between milieus, intermixings. Rhythms pertain to these interstratic movements, which are also acts of stratification. Stratification is like the creation of the world from chaos, a continual, renewed creation. And the strata constitute the Judgment of God. Classical artists are like God, they make the world by organizing forms and substances, codes and milieus, and rhythms. Articulation, which is constitutive of a stratum, is always a double articulation (double pincer). What is articulated is *a content and an  expression. *Whereas form and substance are not really distinct, con tent and expression are. Hjelmslev's net is applicable to the strata: articulation of content and articulation of expression, with content and expression each possessing its own form and substance. Between them, between content and expression, there is neither a correspon dence nor a cause-effect relation nor a signified-signifier relation:

CONCLUSION: CONCRETE RULES AND ABSTRACT MACHINES D 503 there is real distinction, reciprocal presupposition, and only isomor-phy. But content and expression are not distinguished from each other in the same fashion on each stratum: the distribution of content and expression is not the same on the three major strata (there is, for example, a "linearization" of expression on the organic stratum, and a "superlinearity" of the anthropomorphic strata). That is why the molar and the molecular have very different combinations depending on the stratum considered. 3 What movement, what impulse, sweeps us outside the strata and *(metastratd)"] *Of course, there is no reason to think that all matter is 4 confined to the physicochemical strata: there exists a submolecular, unformed Matter. Similarly, not all Life is confined to the organic strata: rather, the organism is that which life sets against itself in order to limit itself, and there is a life all the more intense, all the more pow erful for being anorganic. There are also nonhuman Becomings of human beings that overspill the anthropomorphic strata in all direc tions. But how can we reach this "plane," or rather how can we con struct it, and how can we draw the "line" leading us there? For outside the strata or in the absence of strata we no longer have forms or sub stances, organization or development, content or expression. We are disarticulated; we no longer even seem to be sustained by rhythms. How could unformed matter, anorganic life, nonhuman becoming be anything but chaos pure and simple? Every undertaking of destratification (for example, going beyond the organism, plunging into a becoming) must therefore observe concrete rules of extreme 6 caution: a too-sudden destratification may be suicidal, or turn can cerous. In other words, it will sometimes end in chaos, the void and destruction, and sometimes lock us back into the strata, which become more rigid still, losing their degrees of diversity, differentia tion, and mobility. A *Assemblages* Assemblages are already different from strata. They are produced in 11 the strata, but operate in zones where milieus become decoded: they begin by extracting a *territory *from the milieus. Every assemblage is basically territorial. The first concrete rule for assemblages is to dis cover what territoriality they envelop, for there always is one: in their trash can or on their bench, Beckett's characters stake out a territory. Discover the territorial assemblages of someone, human or animal:

0 504 □ CONCLUSION: CONCRETE RULES AND ABSTRACT MACHINES "home." The territory is made of decoded fragments of all kinds, which are borrowed from the milieus but then assume the value of "properties": even rhythms take on a new meaning (refrains). The ter ritory makes the assemblage. The territory is more than the organism and the milieu, and the relation between the two; that is why the assemblage goes beyond mere "behavior" (hence the importance of the relative distinction between territorial animals and milieu animals). Inasmuch as they are territorial, assemblages still belong to the strata. At least they pertain to them in one of their aspects, and it is under this aspect that we distinguish in every assemblage content 4 from expression. It is necessary to ascertain the content and the expression of each assemblage, to evaluate their real distinction, their reciprocal presupposition, their piecemeal insertions. The reason that the assemblage is not confined to the strata is that expression in it becomes a *semiotic system, *a regime of signs, and content becomes a  *pragmatic system, *actions and passions. This is the double articulation face-hand, gesture-word, and the reciprocal presupposition between the two. This is the first division of every assemblage: it is simultaneously and inseparably a machinic assemblage and an assemblage of enunciation. In each case, it is necessary to ascertain both what is said and what is done. There is a new relation between content and expression that was not yet present in the strata: the statements or expressions express *incorporeal transformations *that are "attributed" as such (properties) to bodies or contents. In the strata, expressions do not form signs, nor contents *pragmata, *so this autonomous zone of incorporeal transformations expressed by the former and attributed to the latter does not appear. Of course, regimes of signs develop only in the alloplastic or anthropomorphic strata (including territorialized animals). But this does not mean that they do not permeate all of the strata, and overspill each of them. Assemblages belong to the strata to the extent that the distinction between content and expression still holds for them. We may also think of regimes of signs and pragmatic systems as strata in their own right, in the broad sense previously mentioned. But because the content-expression distinction assumes a new figure, we are already in a different element than that of the strata in the narrow sense. The assemblage is also divided along another axis. Its territoriality (content and expression included) is only a first aspect; the other aspect is constituted by *lines of deterritorialization *that cut across it and carry it away. These lines are very diverse: some open the territor ial assemblage onto other assemblages (for example, the territorial

Others operate directly upon the territoriality of the assemblage, and open it onto a land that is eccentric, immemorial, or yet to come (for example, the game of territory and the earth in the lied, or in the romantic 11 artist in general). Still others open assemblages onto abstract and cos-and mic machines that they effectuate. The territoriality of the assem-4 blage originates in a certain decoding of milieus, and is just as necessarily extended by lines of deterritorialization. The territory is just as inseparable from deterritorialization as the code from decoding. Following these lines, the assemblage no longer presents an expression distinct from content, only unformed matters, destrati-fied forces, and functions. The concrete rules of assemblage thus operate along these two axes: On the one hand, what is the territoriality of the assemblage, what is the regime of signs and the pragmatic system? On the other hand, what are the cutting edges of deterritorialization, and what abstract machines do they effectuate? The assemblage is tetravalent: (1) content and expression; (2) territoriality and deterritorialization. That is why there were four aspects in the privileged example of Kafka's assemblages. R *Rhizome* Not only strata, assemblages are complexes of lines. We can identify a first state of the line, or a first kind of line: the line is subordinated to the point; the diagonal is subordinated to the horizontal and vertical; the line forms a contour, whether figurative or not; the space it consti tutes is one of striation; the countable multiplicity it constitutes remains subordinated to the One in an always superior or supplemen tary dimension. Lines of this type are molar, and form a segmentary, circular, binary, arborescent system. The second kind is very different, molecular and of the "rhizome" type. The diagonal frees itself, breaks or twists. The line no longer forms a contour, and instead passes *between *things, *between *points. It belongs to a smooth space. It draws a plane that has no more dimen sions than that which crosses it; therefore the multiplicity it consti tutes is no longer subordinated to the One, but takes on a consistency of its own. These are multiplicities of masses or packs, not of classes; anomalous and nomadic multiplicities, not normal or legal ones; multiplicities of becoming, or transformational multiplicities, not countable elements and ordered relations; fuzzy, not exact aggre **10** 9 and 1 2 10 12 and 14

0 506 D CONCLUSION: CONCRETE RULES AND ABSTRACT MACHINES gates, etc. At the level *of pathos, *these multiplicities are expressed by psychosis and especially schizophrenia. At the level of pragmatics, they are utilized by sorcery. At the level of theory, the status of multi plicities is correlative to that of spaces, and vice versa: smooth spaces of the type desert, steppe, or sea are not without people; they are not depopulated but rather are populated by multiplicities of this second kind (mathematics and music have gone quite far in the elaboration of this theory of multiplicities). It is not enough, however, to replace the opposition between the One and the multiple with a distinction between types of multiplici 9 ties. For the distinction between the two types does not preclude their immanence to each other, each "issuing" from the other after its fash ion. It is not so much that some multiplicities are arborescent and others not, but that there is an arborification of multiplicities. That is what happens when the black holes scattered along a rhizome begin to resonate together, or when the stems form segments that striate space in all directions, rendering it comparable, divisible, homoge 12 neous (as we saw in particular in the case of the Face). That is also what happens when "mass" movements or molecular flows conjugate at points of accumulation or stoppage that segment and rectify them. But conversely, and without symmetry, the stems of the rhizome are always taking leave of the trees, the masses and flows are constantly escaping, inventing connections that jump from tree to tree and uproot them: a whole smoothing of space, which in turn reacts back upon striated space. Even, and especially, territories are perturbed by these deep movements. Or language: the trees of language are shaken by buddings and rhizomes. So that rhizome lines oscillate between 8 tree lines that segment and even stratify them, and lines of flight or and rupture that carry them away. 9 We are therefore made of three lines, but each kind of line has its dangers. Not only the segmented lines that cleave us, and impose upon us the striations of a homogeneous space, but also the molecular lines, already ferrying their micro-black holes, and finally the lines of flight themselves, which always risk abandoning their creative poten tialities and turning into a line of death, being turned into a line of destruction pure and simple (fascism). **C** *Plane of Consistency, Body without Organs * The plane of consistency or of composition (planomenon) is opposed

Organization and development concern form and substance: at once the development of form and the formation of substance or a subject. But the plane of consistency knows nothing of substance and form: haecceities, which are inscribed on this plane, are precisely modes of individuation pro ceeding neither by form nor by the subject. The plane consists abstractly, but really, in relations of speed and slowness between unformed elements, and in compositions of corresponding intensive affects (the "longitude" and "latitude" of the plane). In another sense, consistency concretely ties together heterogeneous, disparate ele 11 ments as such: it assures the consolidation of fuzzy aggregates, in other words, multiplicities of the rhizome type. In effect, consistency, proceeding by consolidation, acts necessarily in the middle, by the middle, and stands opposed to all planes of principle or finality. Spinoza, Holderlin, Kleist, Nietzsche are the surveyors of such a plane of consistency. Never unifications, never totalizations, but rather consistencies or consolidations. 10 Inscribed on the plane of consistency are *haecceities, *events, incor poreal transformations that are apprehended in themselves; *nomadic  essences, *vague yet rigorous; *continuums of intensities *or continuous 4, 6 variations, which go beyond constants and variables; *becomings,* *1, *9 which have neither culmination nor subject, but draw one another into zones of proximity or undecidability; *smooth spaces, *composed from within striated space. We will say that a body without organs, or 6  bodies without organs (plateaus) comes into play in individuation by and haecceity, in the production of intensities beginning at a degree zero, 10 in the matter of variation, in the medium of becoming or transforma tion, and in the smoothing of space. A powerful nonorganic life that 14 escapes the strata, cuts across assemblages, and draws an abstract line without contour, a line of nomad art and itinerant metallurgy. Does the plane of consistency constitute the body without organs, or does the body without organs compose the plane? Are the Body without Organs and the Plane the same thing? In any event, composer and composed have the same power: the line does not have a dimen sion superior to that of the point, nor the surface to that of the line, 10 nor the volume to that of the surface, but always an anexact, frac-and tional number of dimensions that constantly increase or decrease 14 with the number of its parts. The plane sections multiplicities of vari able dimensions. The question is, therefore, the mode of connection between the different parts of the plane: To what extent do the bodies without organs interconnect? How are the continuums of intensity extended? What is the order of the transformational series? What are

The plane is like a row of doors. And the concrete rules for the construction of the plane obtain to the extent that they exercise a selective role. It is the plane, in other words, the mode of connection, that provides the means of eliminating the empty and cancerous bodies that rival the body without organs, of rejecting the homogeneous surfaces that overlay smooth space, and neutralizing the lines of death and destruction that divert the line of flight. What is retained and preserved, therefore created, what consists, is only  *that which increases the number of connections *at each level of division or composition, thus in descending as well as ascending order (that which is cannot be divided without changing in nature, or enter into a larger composition without requiring a new criterion of comparison...). D *Deterritorialization* The function of deterritorialization: D is the movement by which 5 "one" leaves the territory. It is the operation of the line of flight. There are very different cases. D may be overlaid by a compensatory reterritorialization obstructing the line of flight: D is then said to be  *negative. *Anything can serve as a reterritorialization, in other words, "stand for" the lost territory; one can reterritorialize on a being, an object, a book, an apparatus or system.. . For example, it is inaccurate to say that the State apparatus is territorial: it in fact performs a D, but one immediately overlaid by reterritorializations on property, work, and money (clearly, that landowner ship, public or private, is not territorial but reterritorializing). Among regimes of signs, the  *signifying regime *certainly attains a high level of D; but because it simultaneously sets up a whole system of reterritorializations on the signified, and on the signifier itself, it blocks the line of flight, allowing only a negative D to persist. Another case is when D becomes positive—in other words, when it prevails over the reterritorializations, which play only a secondary role—but nevertheless remains *relative * because the line of flight it draws is segmented, is divided into successive "proceedings," sinks into black holes, or even ends up in a generalized black hole (catastrophe). This is the case of the *regime of  subjective signs, *with its passional and consciousness-related D, which is positive but only in

It will be noted immediately that these two major forms of D are not in a simple evolutionary relation to each other: the second may break away from the first, or it may lead into it (nota bly when the segmentations of converging lines of flight bring an overall reterritorialization or one benefiting a particular segment, thus arresting the movement of escape). There are all kinds of mixed figures, assuming highly varied forms of D. Is there *absolute *D, and what does "absolute" mean? We must first have a better understanding of the relations between D, the territory, reterritorialization, and the earth. To begin with, the terri tory itself is inseparable from vectors of deterritorialization work 9 ing it from within: either because the territoriality is supple and and "marginal," in other words, itinerant, or because the territorial 13 assemblage itself opens onto and is carried off by other types of 11 assemblages. Second, D is in turn inseparable from correlative reterritorializations. D is never simple, but always multiple and composite: not only because it participates in various forms at the same time, but also because it converges distinct speeds and movements on the basis of which one may assign at a given moment a "deterritorialized element" and a "deterritorializing element." Now, reterritorialization as an original operation does not express a return to the territory, but rather these differential relations inter-7 nal to D itself, this multiplicity internal to the line of flight (cf. "The-and orems of D"). Finally, the earth is not at all the opposite of D: This 10 can already be seen in the mystery of the "natal," in which the earth as ardent, eccentric, or intense focal point is outside the territory 11 and exists only in the movement of D. More than that, the earth, the glacial, is Deterritorialization par excellence: that is why it belongs 3 to the Cosmos, and presents itself as the material through which human beings tap cosmic forces. We could say that the earth, as deterritorialized, is itself the strict correlate of D. To the point that D can be called the creator of the earth—of a new land, a universe, not just a reterritorialization. This is the meaning of "absolute." The absolute expresses nothing transcendent or undifferentiated. It does not even express a quantity that would exceed all given (relative) quantities. It expresses only a type of movement qualitatively different from relative movement. A movement is absolute when, whatever its quantity and speed, it 7 relates "a" body considered as multiple to a smooth space that it and occupies in the manner of a vortex. A movement is relative, whatever 14 its quantity and speed, when it relates a body considered as *One *to a striated space through which it moves, and which it measures with

0 510 □ CONCLUSION: CONCRETE RULES AND ABSTRACT MACHINES straight lines, if only virtual. D is negative or relative (yet already effective) when it conforms to the second case and operates either by principal reterritorializations that obstruct the lines of flight, or by secondary reterritorializations that segment and work to curtail them. D is absolute when it conforms to the first case and brings about the creation of a new earth, in other words, when it connects lines of flight, raises them to the power of an abstract vital line, or draws a plane of consistency. Now what complicates everything is that this absolute D necessarily proceeds by way of relative D, pre cisely because it is not transcendent. Conversely, relative or negative D itself requires an absolute for its operation: it makes the absolute something "encompassing," something totalizing that overcodes the earth and then conjugates lines of flight in order to stop them, destroy them—rather than connecting them in order to create (it is in this sense that we have opposed *conjunction *to *connection, *although we have often treated them as synonyms from a very general point of view). Thus there is a limitative absolute already at work in properly 9 negative, or even relative, D's. Above all, at this turning point the and lines of flight are not only obstructed or segmented but turn into lines 14 of destruction or death. For the stakes here are indeed the negative and the positive in the absolute: the earth girded, encompassed, 11 overcoded, conjugated as the object of a mortuary and suicidal organization surrounding it on all sides, *or *the earth consolidated, connected with the Cosmos, brought into the Cosmos following lines of creation that cut across it as so many becomings (Nietzsche's expression: Let the earth become lightness . . .). There are thus at least four forms of D that confront and combine, and must be distin guished from one another following concrete rules. M *Abstract Machines (Diagram and Phylum)* There is no abstract machine, or machines, in the sense of a Platonic Idea, transcendent, universal, eternal. Abstract machines operate within concrete assemblages: They are defined by the fourth aspect of assemblages, in other words, the cutting edges of decoding and 11 deterritorialization. They draw these cutting edges. Therefore they make the territorial assemblage open onto something else, assemblages of another type, the molecular, the cosmic; they constitute becomings. Thus they are always singular and immanent. Contrary to the strata, and the assemblages considered under their other aspects,

0 CONCLUSION: CONCRETE RULES AND ABSTRACT MACHINES □ 511 abstract machines know nothing of forms and substances. This is what makes them abstract, and also defines the concept of the machine in the strict sense. They surpass any kind of mechanics. They are opposed to the abstract in the ordinary sense. Abstract machines consist of *unformed matters and nonformal functions. *Every abstract machine is a consolidated aggregate of matters-5 functions *{phylum * and *diagram). *This is evident on a technological "plane": such a plane is not made up simply of formed substances (aluminum, plastic, electric wire, etc.) or organizing forms (program, prototypes, etc.), but of a composite of unformed matters exhibiting only degrees of intensity (resistance, conductivity, heating, stretching, speed or delay, induction, transduction . . .) and diagrammatic functions exhibiting only differential equations or, more generally, "tensors." Of course, within the dimensions of the assemblage, the abstract machine, or machines, is effectuated in forms and substances, in varying states of freedom. But the abstract machine must first have composed itself, and have simultaneously composed a plane of consistency. Abstract, singular, and creative, here and now, real yet nonconcrete, actual yet noneffectuated—that is why abstract machines are dated and named (the Einstein abstract machine, the Webern abstract machine, but also the Galileo, the Bach, or the Beethoven, etc.). Not that they refer to people or to effectuating moments; on the contrary, it is the names and dates that refer to the singularities of the machines, and to what they effectuate. But if abstract machines know nothing of form and substance, what happens to the other determination of strata, or even of assemblages—content and expression? In a certain sense, it could be said that this distinction is also irrelevant to the abstract machine, 3 precisely because it no longer has the forms and substances the dis tinction requires. The plane of consistency is a plane of continuous variation; each abstract machine can be considered a "plateau" of variation that places variables of content and expression in continu ity. Content and expression thus attain their highest level of relativ ity, becoming "functives of one and the same function" or materials of a single matter [see 4, "November 20, 1923: Postulates of Linguis tics," note 21—Trans.]. But in another sense, it could be said that the 4 distinction subsists, and is even recreated, on the level *oi traits: *there and are traits of content (unformed matters or intensities) and traits of 5 expression (nonformal functions or tensors). Here, the distinction has become entirely displaced, or even a different distinction, since it now concerns cutting edges of deterritorialization. Absolute deter ritorialization implies a "deterritorializing element" and a "deterri

Thus both content and expression are necessarily affected by continuous variation, but it still assigns them two dissymmetrical roles as elements of a single becoming, or as quanta of a single flow. That is why it is impossible to define a continuous variation that would not take in both the content and the expression, rendering them indiscernible, while simultaneously proceeding by one *or *the other, determining the two mobile and relative poles of that which has become indiscernible. For this reason, one must define both traits or intensities of content and traits or ten-1, 2 sors of expression *(indefinite article, proper  name, infinitive, and *4, 10 *date), *which take turns leading one another across the plane of consistency. Unformed matter, the phylum, is not dead, brute, homo-12 geneous matter, but a matter-movement bearing singularities or haecceities, qualities, and even operations (itinerant technological lineages); and the nonformal function, the diagram, is not an inexpressive metalanguage lacking a syntax, but an expressivity-movement always bearing a foreign tongue within each language and 4 nonlinguistic categories within language as a whole (nomad poetic lineages). One writes, then, on the same level as the real of an unformed matter, at the same time as that matter traverses and extends all of nonformal language: a becoming-animal like Kafka's 10 mouse [p. 243], Hofmannsthal's rats [p. 240], Moritz's calves [p. 240]? A revolutionary machine, all the more abstract for being real. A regime that no longer operates by the signifier or the subjective. That covers singular and immanent abstract machines. What we have said does not preclude the possibility of "the" abstract machine serving as a transcendent model, under very particular conditions. This time the concrete assemblages are related to an abstract idea of the Machine and, depending on how they effectuate it, are assigned coefficients taking into account their potentialities, their creativity. The coefficients that "quantify" assemblages bear on the varying assemblage components (territory, deterritorialization, reterritori-alization, earth, Cosmos), the various entangled lines constituting the "map" of an assemblage (molar lines, molecular lines, lines of flight), and the different relations-between the assemblage and the plane of consistency (phylum and diagram). For example, the "grass stem" component may have different coefficients in assemblages of 11 animal species that are nevertheless closely related [p. 324-25]. As a general rule, an assemblage is all the closer to the abstract machine the more lines without contour passing between things it has, and the

We have considered in particular two great alloplastic and anthro pomorphic assemblages, *the war machine and the State apparatus. * These two assemblages not only differ in nature but are quantifiable in relation to "the" abstract machine in different ways. They do not have the same relation to the phylum, the diagram; they do not have the same lines, or the same components. This analysis of the two 12 assemblages and their coefficients demonstrates *that the war ma- * and *chine does not in itself have war for its object, *but necessarily adopts it 13 as its object when it allows itself to be appropriated by the State appa ratus. At this very precise point, the line of flight and the abstract vital line it effectuates turn into a line of death and destruction. Hence the name war "machine," which is much closer to the abstract machine than is the State apparatus, which divests the war machine of its power of metamorphosis. Writing and music can be war machines. The more an assemblage opens and multiplies connections and draws a plane of consistency with its quantifiers of intensities and of consol 1, 4 idation, the closer it is to the living abstract machine. But it strays 5, 9 from it to the extent that it replaces creative connections with con 12 junctions causing blockages *(axiomatics), *organizations forming and strata *(stratometers), *reterritorializations forming black holes 14 *(segmentometers), *and conversions into lines of death *(deleometers). * Thus there is a whole process of selection of assemblages according to their ability to draw a plane of consistency with an increasing number of connections. Schizoanalysis is not only a qualitative analysis of abstract machines in relation to the assemblages, but also a quantita tive analysis of the assemblages in relation to a presumably pure abstract machine. There is one last point of view, that of typological analysis. For there exist general types of abstract machines. The abstract machine or machines of the plane of consistency do not exhaust or dominate the entirety of the operations that constitute the strata and even the assemblages. The strata "take" on the plane of consistency itself, forming areas of thickening, coagulations, and belts organized and developing along the axes of another plane (substance-form, content-3 expression). This means that each stratum has a unity of consistency or of composition relating above all to substantial elements and formal traits, and testifying to the existence of a properly stratic abstract machine presiding over this other plane. And there is a third type: on the alloplastic strata, which are particularly propitious for the assem

514 □ CONCLUSION: CONCRETE RULES AND ABSTRACT MACHINES blages, there arise abstract machines that compensate for deterritori-9 alizations with reterritorializations, and especially for decodings with overcodings or overcoding equivalents. We have seen in particular that if abstract machines open assemblages they also close them. 4, 7 An order-word machine overcodes language, a faciality machine and overcodes the body and even the head, a machine of enslavement 8 overcodes or axiomatizes the earth: these are in no way illusions, but real machinic effects. We can no longer place the assemblages on a quantitative scale measuring how close or far they are from the plane of consistency. There are different types of abstract machines that overlap in their operations and qualify the assemblages: *abstract machines of * *consistency, *singular and mutant, with multiplied connections; *abstract * *machines of stratification *that surround the plane 5 of consistency with another plane; and *axiomatic or overcoding *and *abstract machines * that perform totalizations, homogenizations, con-13 junctions of closure. Every abstract machine is linked to other abstract machines, not only because they are inseparably political, economic, scientific, artistic, ecological, cosmic—perceptive, affective, active, thinking, physical, and semiotic—but because their various types are as intertwined as their operations are convergent.

"That is why the only place files on people can be kept is right in each person's home, since they alone are capable of filling in the description and keeping it up to date: society itself is the only possible data bank on peo ple. A naturally acentered society rejects the centralizing automaton as an asocial intrusion" (p. 62). On the "Firing Squad Theorem," see pp. 51-57. It even happens that generals, dream ing of appropriating the formal techniques of guerrilla warfare, appeal to *multiplicities *"of synchronous modules ... based on numerous but independent lightweight cells" having in theory only a minimum of central power and "hierarchical relaying"; see Guy Brossollet,  *Essai surla non-bataille *(Paris: Belin, 1975). 16.

This book contains a fine analysis of geography and its role in American mythology and literature, and of the reversal of directions. In the East, there was the search for a specifi cally American code and for a recoding with Europe (Henry James, Eliot, Pound, etc.); in the South, there was the overcoding of the slave system, with its ruin and the ruin of the planta tions during the Civil War (Faulkner, Caldwell); from the North came capitalist decoding (Dos Passos, Dreiser); the West, however, played the role of a line of flight combining travel, hallucination, madness, the Indians, perceptive and mental experimentation, the shifting of frontiers, the rhizome (Ken Kesey and his "fog machine," the beat generation, etc.). Every great American author creates a cartography, even in his or her style; in contrast to what is done in Europe, each makes a map that is directly connected to the real social movements crossing America. An example is the indexing of geographical directions throughout the work of Fitzgerald. 19. [ TRANS : Karl Wittfogel, *Oriental Despotism *(New Haven, Conn.: Yale University Press, 1957).] 20.

522 □ NOTES TO PP. 48-62 8. Edmond Perrier deserves a place, although not a decisive one, in this long history. He returned to the problem of unity of composition, updating the work of Geoffroy with the aid of Darwin, and especially Lamarck. Perrier's entire work is organized around two themes: animal colonies or multiplicities, and the speeds necessary to account for het erodox degrees and foldings ("tachygenesis"). For example, the brain of a vertebrate may come to occupy the position of the mouth of an annelid, in the "fight between the mouth and the brain." See *Les colonies animates et la formation des organismes *(Paris: G. Mas-son, 1881), and "L'origine des embranchements du regne animal," *Scienta * (May-June 1918). Perrier wrote a history entitled *Philosophie zoologique avant Darwin * (Paris: Alcan, 1884), which includes excellent chapters on Geoffroy and Cuvier. 9.

That is why we consider Hjelmslev, despite his own reservations and vacillations, to be the only linguist to have actually broken with the signifier and the signified.

He shows that  they are irreducible to the signifier-signified couple. He also explains why the title of one of  his earlier books, *Les mots et les choses *[Words and Things, translated as *The Order of Things  *(New York: Vintage, 1970)], must be understood negatively (pp. 48-49). 30.

524 □ NOTES TO PP. 77-82 (Coral Gables, Fla.: University of Miami Press, 1971), p. 53: "There is no indication, for example, that a bee goes off to another hive with the message it has received in its own hive. This would constitute a kind of transmission or relay." 7. William Labov has clearly shown the contradiction, or at least paradox, created by the distinction between language and speech: language is defined as the "social part" of language, and speech is consigned to individual variations; but since the social part is self-enclosed, it necessarily follows that a single individual would be enough to illustrate the principles of lan guage, without reference to any outside data, whereas speech could only be studied in a social context. The same paradox recurs from Saussure to Chomsky: "The social aspect of language is studied by observing any one individual, but the individual aspect only by observing lan guage in its social context"; Labov, *Sociolinguistic Patterns *(Philadelphia: University of Penn sylvania Press, 1972), p. 186. 8. Benveniste, *Problems in General Linguistics, *part 4 ("Man and Language"); on the elimination of the illocutionary, see pp. 237-238. 9. Oswald Ducrot, *Dire et nepas dire *(Paris: Hermann, 1972), pp. 70-80, and "De Saus sure a la philosophie du langage," preface to the French translation of S. R. Searle's *Speech  Acts, Actes de langage *(Paris: Hermann, 1972). Ducrot challenges the notions of linguistic information and code, and communication and subjectivity. He develops a theory of "linguistic presupposition" or nondiscursive implicitness, as opposed to concluded and discursive implicitness still referring to a code. He constructs a pragmatics covering all of linguistics and moves toward a study of assemblages of enunciation, considered from a "juridical," "polemi cal," or "political" point of view. 10. Bakhtin and Labov have stressed the social character of enunciation, in different ways. They are consequently in opposition not only to subjectivism but also to structuralism, to the extent that the latter ties the system of language to the understanding of an ideal indi vidual, and social factors to actual individuals as speakers. 11. Ducrot, *Dire et nepas dire, *p. 77: "To qualify an action as criminal (theft, fraud, black mail, etc.) is not, in our sense of the term, to present it as an *act *since the legal situation of guilt, which defines a crime, is supposed to derive from other given consequences of the activity described: the activity is considered punishable because it is harmful to another person, to order, to society, etc. The judge's statement of a sentence can, on the other hand, be consid ered a juridical act because there is no intervening effect between the speech of the judge and the transformation of the accused into a convict." 12. John Kenneth Galbraith, *Money *(Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1975), chapter 12, "The Ultimate Inflation": "On November 20, 1923, the curtain was rolled down. As in Austria a year earlier, the end came suddenly. As with the milder French inflation, *the end came *with astonishing ease. Perhaps it ended simply because it could not go on. On November 20, the old reichsmark *was declared *to be no longer money. A new currency, the rentenmark, was introduced .... The new rentenmark *was declared *to be backed by a first mortgage on all the land and other physical assets of the Reich. This idea had its ancestry in the assignats; it was, however, appreciably *more fraudulent *[Galbraith means to say 'deterritorialized'—Au.]. In France in 1789, there was extant, visible land freshly taken from the church for which cur rency initially could be exchanged; any German seeking to exercise rights of foreclosure on German property with his rentenmarks would have been thought mentally unstable. Never theless, it worked. Circumstances helped.. . . If, after 1923, the previous claims on the Ger man budget had continued—the reparations claims and the cost of passive resistance— nothing would have saved the mark and [the head of the Reichsbank's] reputation"; pp. 159, 161. 13.

NOTES TO PP. 82-91 □ 525 "L'economie des echanges linguistiques," in *Linguistique et sociolinguistique, Langue  Francaise, *May 1977, pp. 18-21. 14. The very notion of the proletarian class hinges on the question, Does the proletariat already exist at a given moment, and if so as a body? (Or, does it still exist?) It is evident that Marxists use it in an anticipatory sense, as, for example, when they speak of an "embryonic proletariat." 15. [ TRANS : V. I. Lenin, "On Slogans," *Selected Works *(Moscow: Progress Publishers, 1975), vol. 3, p. 148.] 16. Quoted by David Cooper, *The Language of Madness *(London: Allen Lane, 1978), p. 34\. Cooper comments that "the language of 'hearing voices' ... means that one becomes aware of something that exceeds the consciousness of normal [i.e., direct] discourse and which therefore must be experienced as 'other'" (p. 34). 17. Elias Canetti is one of the rare authors who has dealt with the psychological mode of action of the order-word, or "command": *Crowds and Power, *trans. Carol Stewart (New York: Viking Press, 1963), pp. 303-333. He hypothesizes that an order inflicts a kind of sting on the soul, which forms a cyst, a hardening that never goes away. When this happens, the only way to find relief is to pass it on to others as quickly as possible, to "massify," even though the mass may turn back against the emitter of the order-word. In addition, the fact that the order-word is like a foreign body within the body, an indirect discourse within speech, explains the extraordinary forgetting that occurs: "The person who carries out a command. . . does not accuse himself, but the sting: this is the true culprit, whom he carries with him everywhere.... It is his permanent witness that it was not he himself who perpe trated a given wrong. He sees himself as its victim and thus has no feeling left for the real vic tim. It is true, therefore, that people who have acted on orders can feel entirely guiltless," making it all the easier for them to move on to other order-words (p. 332). This provides a profound explanation for the Nazis' feeling of innocence, or for the capacity of forgetfulness displayed by old Stalinists, whose amnesia worsens the more they invoke their memory and past in order to claim the right to follow new and even more insidious orderwords—"sting mania." In this respect, Canetti's analysis seems essential. However, it presupposes the exis tence of a very particular psychic faculty in the absence of which the orderword would not have this mode of action. The whole classical rationalist theory—of "common sense," of universally shared good sense based on information and communication—is a way to cover up or hide, and to justify in advance, a much more disturbing faculty, that of order-words. This singularly irrational faculty is best safeguarded by gracing it with the name of pure rea son, by saying that it is nothing but pure reason ... 18.

Stalin, in his famous text on linguistics *[Marxism and Linguistics *(New York: Inter national Publishers, 1951)—Trans.], claims to identify two neutral forms serving all of soci ety, all classes, and all regimes equally: instruments and machines as pure means of production of goods, and language as a pure means of information and communication. Even Bakhtin defines language as the form of ideology, but he specifies that the form of ide ology is not itself ideological. 22. On these problems, see J. M. Sadock, "Hypersentences" (Diss.

Saumjan proposes a model of abstract objects based on the operation of application called AGM (applicative generative model). He cites Hjelmslev as an influence; Hjelmslev's strength is to have conceived of the form of expression and the form of content as two entirely relative variables on one and the same plane, as "functives of one and the same function," Hjelmslev, *Prolegomena to a Theory  of Language, *trans. Francis J. Whitfield (Madison; University of Wisconsin Press, 1969). This advance toward a diagrammatic conception of the abstract machine is, however, coun teracted by the fact that Hjelmslev still conceives the distinction between expression and con tent in the signifier-signified mode and therefore retains the subordination of the abstract machine to linguistics. 23.

Synge (see Francois Regnault's remarks on coordination in Anglo-Irish in the French translation of *Playboy of the Western World, Baladin du monde occidental *[Paris: Biblio-theque du Graphe]). It should not be thought adequate to analyze the "and" as a conjunction; rather, "and" is a special form of every possible conjunction and brings into play a logic of language.

NOTES TO PP. 99-106 □ 527 these variations, treating them as marginal exercises irrelevant to true changes in language; still, his comments seem to us to transcend all of these interpretive restrictions. 35. See Vidal Sephiha, "Introduction a l'etude de l'intensif," *Langages, *no. 29 (March 1973). This is one of the first studies of the atypical tensions and variations of language, par ticularly as they appear in so-called minor languages. 36. On the expansion and diffusion of states of language, in the "patch of oil" mode or the "paratrooper" mode, see Bertil Malmberg, *New Trends in Linguistics, *trans. Edward Carners (Stockholm: Lund, 1964), chapter 3 (which uses N. Lindqvist's important studies on dialect). What are needed now are comparative studies of how homogenizations and centralizations of given major languages take place. In this respect, the linguistic history of French is not at all the same as that of English; neither is their relation to writing as a form of homogenization the same. For French, the centralized language par excellence, one may refer to the analysis of Michel de Certeau, Dominique Julia, and Jacques Revel, *Une politique de la langue *(Paris: Gallimard, 1975). The analysis covers a very brief period at the end of the eighteenth century, focusing on Abbot Gregory, and notes two distinct periods: one in which the central language opposed the rural dialects, just as the town opposed the countryside, and the capital the prov inces; and another in which it opposed "feudal idioms," as well as the language of the emigres, just as the Nation opposes everything that is foreign to it, an enemy of it (pp. 160ff: "It is also obvious that the rejection of the dialects resulted from a technical inability to grasp stable laws in regional speech patterns"). 37. See Michel Lalonde, *Change, *no. 30 (March 1977), pp. 100-122, where the poem, "Speak White," quoted in text, appears, along with a manifesto on the Quebecois language ("La deffense et illustration de la langue quebecqoyse"). 38. On the complex situation of Afrikaans, see Breyten Breytenbach's fine book, *Feu * *Froid *(Paris: Bourgois, 1976); G. M. Lory's study (pp. 101-107) elucidates Breytenbach's project, the violence of his poetic treatment of the language, and his will to be a "bastard, with a bastard language." 39. On the double aspect of minor language, poverty-ellipsis, and overload-variation, one may refer to a certain number of exemplary studies: Klauss Wagenbach's study of the German of Prague at the beginning of the twentieth century *(Franz Kafka. Eine Biographie seiner  Jugend *[Bern: Francke, 1958]); Pasolini's study demonstrating that Italian was not con structed on the basis of a new standard or mean, but exploded in two simultaneous directions, "upward and downward," in other words, toward simplified material and expressive exagger ation *(L'experience heretique, *pp. 46-47); J. L. Dillard's study bringing out the double ten dency of Black English on the one hand to omit, lose, disencumber, and on the other to overload, to develop "fancy talk" *{Black English *[New York: Random House, 1972]). As Dillard notes, there is no inferiority to the standard language; instead there is a correlation between two movements that necessarily escape from the standard level of language. Still on the topic of Black English, LeRoi Jones shows the extent to which the two conjoined direc tions approximate language to music *(Blues People *[New York: William Morrow, 1963], pp. 30-31 and all of chapter 3). On a more general level, one will recall Pierre Boulez's analysis of a double movement in music, dissolution of form, and dynamic overload or proliferation: *Con-  versations with Celestin Deliege, *(London: Eulenberg Books, 1976), pp. 20-22. 40.

Tircher, 1838) (to what extent is "monomania" distinguishable from mania?); and Emil Kraepelin, *Psychiatrie. Ein Lehrbuch fur Studierende undArtze, *8th ed. (Leipzig: J. A. Barth, 1920) [English translation, *Lectures on Clinical Psychiatry, *rpt., ed. Thomas Johnstone (New York: Hafner, 1968)] (to what extent is "querulous delusion" distin guishable from paranoia?). The question of the second group of delusions, or the passional delusions, was broached and analyzed historically by Jacques Lacan, *De la psychose  parano'iaque *(Paris: Seuil, 1975), and by Daniel Lagache, *La jalousie amoureuse *(Paris: PUF, 1947). 10. See Serieux and Capgras, *Lesfolies raisonnantes, *pp. 340ff, and Clerambault, *Oeuwe * *psychiatrique, *pp. 369ff: people with passional delusion are overlooked, even in the asylum, because they are calm and cunning, "suffering from a limited enough delusion that they know how we judge them." This makes it all the more necessary to keep them confined; "such patients must not be questioned, but rather maneuvered, and the only way to maneuver them is to move them emotionally." 11. Esquirol suggests that monomania is a "disease of civilization" and has a social evolu tion: it begins religious but tends to become more and more political, tracked by the police  *(Des maladies mentales, *vol. 1, p. 400). See also the remarks of Emmanuel Regis, *Les regicides  dans I'histoire et dans le present *(Lyons: A. Storck, 1890). 12. Deuteronomy 1:12.

See Edouard Dhorme, *La religion des Hebreux nomades *(Brussels: Nouvelle Societe d'Editions, 1937), and Zecharia Mayani, *Les Hyksos et le monde de la Bible *(Paris: Payot, 1956). The author emphasizes the connections between the Hebrews and the Ha-biru (nomadic warriors) and Kenites (nomadic metal workers); what is specific to Moses is not the principle of numerical organization, which was borrowed from the nomads, but the idea of an always revocable convention-proceeding, contractproceeding. This idea, according to Mayani, derives neither from the rooted farmers nor from the nomadic warriors, nor even from the migrants, but from a tribe on the march that thinks of itself in terms of subjective destiny. 15. See Franz Kafka, *The Trial, *trans. Willa and Edwin Muir (New York: Schocken, 1968). The painter Titorelli originates the theory of indefinite postponement. Aside from def inite acquittal, which does not exist, Titorelli differentiates the two juridical regimes of "ostensible acquittal" and "indefinite postponement"; the first is circular and linked to a semiotic of the signifier, whereas the second is linear and segmentary, linked to the passional semiotic(pp. 152-162). 16.

(3) But these col-  lective assemblages (school, army, factory, hospital, prison, etc.) are only degrees or singulari-  ties in an abstract "diagram," which for its part has only matter and function (the unspecified  multiplicity of human beings to be controlled). (4) *The History of Sexuality. Vol.  l.Anlntro-duction, *trans. Robert Hurley (New York: Pantheon, 1978), takes yet another  direction since assemblages are no longer related to and contrasted with a diagram, but rather  to a "biopoli-tics of population" as an abstract machine. Our only points of disagreement with  Foucault are the following: (1) to us the assemblages seem fundamentally to be assemblages  not of power but of desire (desire is always assembled), and power seems to be a stratified  dimension of the assemblage; (2) the diagram and abstract machine have lines of flight that are  primary, which are not phenomena of resistance or counterattack in an assemblage, but  cutting edges of creation and deterritorialization. 40. Louis Hjelmslev proposed a very important conception of "matter" or "purport" *(sens) *as unformed, amorphous, or formless: *Prolegomena to a Theory of Language, *trans.  Francis J. Whitfield (Madison: University of Wisconsin Press, 1969), sec. 13, pp. 47-60, and  *Essais linguistiques *(Paris: Minuit, 1971), pp. 58ff. (see also the preface by Francois Rastier,  p. 9). 41. The distinction between indexes, icons, and symbols comes from C. S. Peirce, *Col-* *lected Papers, *ed. Charles Hartshorne and Paul Weiss (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University  Press, 1931-1958). But his distinctions are based on signifier-signified relations (contiguity  for the index, similitude for the icon, conventional rule for the symbol); this leads him to make  the "diagram" a special case of the icon (the icon of relation). Peirce is the true inventor of  semiotics. That is why we can borrow his terms, even while changing their connotations. First,  indexes, icons, and symbols seem to us to be distinguished by  territoriality-deterritorializa-tion relations, not signifier-signified relations. Second, the  diagram as a result seems to have a distinct role, irreducible to either the icon or the symbol.  On Peirce's fundamental distinctions and the complex status of the diagram, one may refer  to Jakobson's analysis, "A la recherche de l'essence du langage," in *Problemes du langage,  *ed.

Face exercises play an essential role in the pedagogical principles of J.-B. de la Salle.

Lowry's scene is imbedded in such different elements and is so particularly organized that there can be no question of influence by Chretien de Troyes's scene, only confluence with it. This makes it an even better confirmation of the existence of a veritable black hole or red mark-white wall abstract machine (snow or water). 9.

The power  of Negus, with his ancestry going back to Solomon and his court of magicians, was based on  his ember-eyes, operating like a black hole, angelic or demonic. Mercier's analyses in their  entirety constitute an essential contribution to the analysis of facial functions. 15. For Eisenstein's own distinction between his conception of the close-up and Griffith's, see *Film Form and Film Sense.* 16. This is a recurring theme in horror novels and science fiction: the eyes are in the black hole, not the opposite ("I see a luminous disk emerging from the black hole, resembling eyes").  Comic books, *Circus *No. 2, for example, depict black holes populated by faces and eyes, and  the traversing of that black hole.

Fleutiaux distinguishes three lines of perception, but without applying a preestablished schema. The hero has *molar perception, *which takes in overall aggregates and clear-cut elements, well-distributed areas of fullness and emptiness (this per ception is coded, inherited, and overcoded by the walls: Don't miss you chair, etc.). But he is also caught up in a *molecular perception *composed of fine and shifting segmentations and autonomous traits, where holes appear in what is full and microforms in emptiness, between two things, where everything "teems and stirs" with a thousand cracks. The hero's problem is that he cannot make up his mind between the two lines and constantly jumps from one to the other.

The State, therefore, is not defined solely by the type of public powers it has, but also as a resonance chamber for private as well as public powers. It is for this reason that Althusser says: "The distinction between public and private is a distinction internal to bourgeois law, and valid in the subordinate domains where bourgeois law exercises its powers. The domain of the State eludes it because it is beyond Law.... It is on the contrary the foundation for any distinction between the public and the private."

On "castrametation": "Geometry is the necessary foundation for a calculated expansion of State power in space and time; conversely, this supplies the State with an ideal, sufficient fig ure, provided that the figure is ideally geometrical. . .. But Fenelon, voicing his opposition to the State policies of Louis XIV, exclaimed: 'Beware the bewitchments and diabolical attributes of geometry!"' 9. Meyer Fortes analyzes the difference among the Tellensi between "guardians of the earth" and chiefs. This distinction between powers is fairly widespread among primitive soci eties; but the important thing is that it is organized in such a way as to prevent the powers from resonating. For example, according to Louis Berthe's analysis of the Baduj of Java, the power of the guardian of the earth, on the one hand, is considered to be passive and feminine but, on the other hand, is assigned to the eldest son: this is not an "intrusion of kinship into the politi cal order" but on the contrary "a requirement of a political order translated in kinship terms" in order to prevent the establishment of a resonance leading to private property.

The strength of Jean-Pierre Faye's book, *Langages totalitaires *(Paris: Hermann, 1972), is that it illustrates the multiplicity of these focuses, both practical and semiotic, on the basis of which Nazism was constituted. That is why Faye is the first both to do a rigorous anal ysis of the concept of the totalitarian State (in its Italian and German origins) and to refuse to define Italian fascism and German Nazism by that concept (which operates on a different plane than the "subjacent process"). Faye goes into all of these points in *La critique du langage  et son economie *(Paris: Galilee, 1973). 12.

NOTES TO PP. 217-224 □ 537 York: Vintage, 1975), of what he calls the "microphysics of power." First, it is indeed a ques tion of miniaturized mechanisms, or molecular focuses operating in detail or in the infinitely small and forming any number of "disciplines" in the school, army, factory, prison, etc. (see pp. 138ff.). But second, these segments themselves, and the focuses operating within them at the molecular level, present themselves as the singularities of an "abstract" diagram coexten sive with the entire social field, or as quanta deducted from a flow of a nonspecific nature— the nonspecific flow being defined by "a multiplicity of individuals" to be controlled (see pp. 205ff. [translation modified]). 17. On "quantitative sinfulness," quanta, and the qualitative leap, one may refer to the microtheology constructed by Sdren Kierkegaard in *The Concept of Dread, *trans. Walter Lowrie (Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press, 1957). 18. According to Tarde, psychology is quantitative, but only insofar as it studies the desire and belief components of sensation. And logic is quantitative when it does not restrict itself to forms of representation, but extends to degrees of belief and desire, and their combinations; see *La logique sociale *(Paris: Alcan, 1893). 19. On all of these points, see especially Maurice Dobb, *Studies in the Development of * *Capitalism, *rev. ed. (New York: International Publishers, 1964), and Georges Duby, *The  Early Growth of the European Economy: Warriors and Peasants from the Seventh to Twelfth  Century, *trans. Howard E. Clarke (London: Weidenfeld &amp;amp; Nicolson, 1974). 20. Rosa Luxemburg, in "Social Reform or Revolution," and "Mass Strike, Party and Trade Unions," in *Selected Political Writings, *ed. Dick Howard (New York: Monthly Review, 1971), formulated the problem of the differences and relations between masses and classes, but from a still-subjective point of view: masses as the "instinctual basis of class conscious ness" (see Nicolas Boulte and Jacques Moiroux, "Masse et Parti," *Partisans, *no. 45, *Rose  Luxemburg vivante *[December-January 1969], pp. 29-38. Alain Badiou and Francois Balmes advance a more objective hypothesis: masses are "invariants" that oppose the State-form in general and exploitation, whereas classes are the historical variables that determine the con crete State, and, in the case of the proletariat, the possibility of its effective dissolution; *De  I'ideologie *[Paris: Maspero, 1976]). But it is difficult to see, first of all, why masses are not themselves historical variables, and second, why the word is applied only to the exploited (the "peasant-plebeian" mass), when it is also suitable for seigneurial, bourgeois masses—or even monetary masses. 21.

("Precisely because they were the weakest, eternally being pushed from behind, they were forced to go the farthest.") 24. Totalitarianism is not defined by the size of the public sector because in many cases there is still a liberal economy. What defines it is the artificial constitution of "closed vessels," particularly monetary and industrial. It is primarily in this sense that Italian fascism and Ger man Nazism were totalitarian States, as demonstrated by Daniel Guerin in *Fascism and Big  Business, *trans. Frances and Mason Merrill (New York: Pioneer Publishers, 1939), chapter 9. 25. Foucault, *Discipline and Punish, *p. 27: "These relations go right down into the depths of society, they are not localized in the relations between the state and its citizens or on the frontier between classes and they do not merely reproduce... the general form of the law or government... .They define innumerable points of confrontation, focuses of instability, each of which has its own risks of conflict, of struggle, and of an at least temporary inversion of the power relation."

Although Hannah Arendt identifies Nazism and totalitarianism, she expressed this principle of Nazi domination: "Their idea of  domination was something that no state and no mere apparatus of violence can ever achieve,  but only a movement that is constantly kept in motion"; *The Origins of Totalitarianism *(New  York: Harcourt, Brace and World, 1966), p. 326; even the war, and the danger of losing the  war, acted as accelerators (pp. 325-326, 394ff, 41 Off., 462ff). 10.1730: Becoming-Intense, Becoming-Animal, Becoming-Imperceptible 1.

On the opposition between sacrificial series and totemic structure, see Levi-Strauss, *The Savage Mind (Chicago: *University of Chicago Press, 1966), pp. 223-228. Despite all of his severity toward the series, Levi-Strauss recognizes the compromise between the two themes: structure itself implies a very concrete feeling for affinities (pp. 37-38) and is based on two series between which it organizes homologies of relations. In particular, "becoming-historical" can bring complications or degradations that replace these homologies with resemblances and identifications between terms (see pp. 115ff., and what Levi-Strauss calls the "flipside of totemism"). 6.

One may also refer to the studies on leopard-man societies, etc., in Black Africa; it is probable that these societies derive from brotherhoods of warriors. But after the colonial State prohibited tribal wars, they turned into crime associations, while still retaining their territorial and political importance. One of the best studies on this subject is Paul Ernest Joset, *Les societes secretes  des hommes-Teopards en Afrique noire *(Paris: Payot, 1955). The becomingsanimal proper to these groups seem to us to be very different from the symbolic relations between human and animal as they appear in State apparatuses, but also in pre-State institutions of the totemism type. Levi-Strauss clearly demonstrates that totemism already implies a kind of embryonic State, to the extent that it exceeds tribal boundaries *(The Savage Mind, *pp. 157ff.). 12.

Gordon analyzes the reaction of the villages and cities when they begin to fight the animal-men in order to win the right to perform their own initiations and order their alli ances according to their respective filiations (for example, the fight against the dragon).

540 □ NOTES TO PP. 247-261 hyene dans la tradition soudanaise," *L'Homme, *1, 2 (May-August 1961), pp. 89-118: the hyena-man lives on the fringes of the village, or between two villages, and can keep a lookout in both directions. A hero, or even two heroes with a fiancee in each other's village, triumphs over the man-animal. It is as though it were necessary to distinguish two very different states of alliance: a demonic alliance that imposes itself from without, and imposes its law upon all of the filiations (a forced alliance with the monster, with the man-animal), and a consensual alliance, which is on the contrary in conformity with the law of filiations and is established after the men of the villages have defeated the monster and have organized their own rela tions. This sheds new light on the question of incest. For it is not enough to say that the prohi bition against incest results from the positive requirements of alliance in general. There is instead a kind of alliance that is so foreign and hostile to filiation that it necessarily takes the position of incest (the man-animal always has a relation to incest). The second kind of alliance prohibits incest because it can subordinate itself to the rights of filiation only by lodging itself, precisely, between two distinct filiations. Incest appears twice, once as a monstrous power of alliance when alliance overturns filiation, and again as a prohibited power of filiation when filiation subordinates alliance and must distribute it among distinct lineages. 22.

The first and simplest case is that of Ulysses' companions, who believed themselves, and were believed to have been, transformed into pigs (or again, King Nebuchadnezzar, transformed into an ox). The second case is more complicated: Diomedes' companions do not believe they have been changed into birds, since they are dead, but demons take over birds' bodies and pass them off as those of Diomedes' companions. The need to distinguish this more complex case is explained by phenomena of transfer of affects; for example, a lord on a hunting excursion cuts off the paw of a wolf and returns home to find his wife, who had not left the house, with a hand cut off; or a man strikes cats, and the exact wounds he inflicts turn up on women. 29.

Gustave Guillaume has proposed a very interesting conception of the verb. He dis tinguishes between an interior time, enveloped in the "process," and an exterior time per taining to the distinction between epochs *(Epoques et niveaux temporels dans lesysteme de  la conjugaisonfrancaise, Cahiers de linguistique structurale *[Universite de Laval, Quebec], no. 4 [1955]). It seems to us that these two poles correspond respectively to the infinitive-becoming, Aeon, and the present-being, Chronos. Each verb leans more or less in the direction of one pole or the other, not only according to its nature, but also according to the nuances of its modes and tenses, with the exception of "becoming" and "being," which correspond to both poles. Proust, in his study of Flaubert's style, shows how the imperfect tense in Flaubert takes on the value of an infinitive-becoming: *Chroniques * (Paris: Gallimard, 1927), pp. 197-199.] 40. On the problem of proper names (in what sense is the proper name outside the limits of classification and of another nature, and in what sense is it at the limit and still a part of classification?), see Alan Henderson Gardiner, *The Theory of Proper Names, *2nd ed. (New York: Oxford University Press, 1957), and Levi-Strauss, *The Savage Mind, *chapter 7 ("Time Regained"), pp. 217-244. 41. We have already encountered this problem of the indifference of psychoanalysis to the use of the indefinite article or pronoun among children: as early as Freud, but more espe cially in Melanie Klein (the children she analyzes, in particular, Little Richard, speak in terms of "a," "one," "people," but Klein exerts incredible pressure to turn them into personal and possessive family locutions). It seems to us that Laplanche and Pontalis are the only ones in psychoanalysis to have had any inkling that indefinites play a specific role; they protested against any overrapid interpretive reduction: "Fantasme originaire," *Les temps modernes, * no. 215 (April 1964), pp. 1861, 1868. 42. See the subjectivist or personalist conception of language in Emile Benveniste, *Prob-* *lems in General Linguistics, *trans.

The essential texts of Maurice Blanchot serve to refute the theory of the "shifter" and of personology in linguistics. See *L'entretien infini *(Paris: Gallimard, 1969), pp. 556-567. And on the difference between the two propositions, "I am unfortunate" and "he is unfortu nate," or between "I die" and "one dies," see *La part du feu *(Paris: Gallimard, 1949), pp. 29-30, and *The Space of Literature, *trans. Ann Smock (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1982), pp. 90, 122, 126. Blanchot demonstrates that in all of these cases the indefinite has nothing to do with "the banality of daily life," which on the contrary would be on the side of the personal pronoun. 44.

See pp. 50, 94-95. 48. See the distinction between the two Planes in Artaud. One of them is denounced as the source of all illusions: *The Peyote Dance *(translation of Las *Tarahumaras), *trans.

"From a plan a group of friends and I made to meet each other again in Mexico 'a year from next Monday.' We were together on a Saturday. And we were never able to fulfil that plan. It's a form of silence.... The very fact that our plan failed, the fact we were unable to meet does not mean that everything failed. The plan wasn't a failure"; John Cage and Daniel Charles, *For the  Birds *(Boston: Marion Boyers, 1981), pp. 116-117. 52. That is why we were able to take Goethe as an example of a transcendental plane. Goethe, however, passes for a Spinozist; his botanical and zoological studies uncover an immanent plane of composition, which allies him to Geoffrey Saint-Hilaire (this resem blance has often been pointed out). Nonetheless, Goethe retains the twofold idea of a devel opment of form and a formation-education of the Subject; for this reason, his plane of immanence has already crossed over to the other side, to the other pole. 53. On all of these points (proliferations-dissolutions, accumulations, indications of speed, the affective and dynamic role), see Pierre Boulez, *Conversations with Celestin  Deliege, *pp. 21-22, 68-71. In another text, Boulez stresses a little-known aspect of Wagner: not only are the leitmotifs freed from their subordination to the scenic characters, but the speeds of development are freed from the hold of a "formal code" or a tempo ("Le temps re-cherche," in *Das Rheingold Programmheft, *vol. I [Bayreuth, 1976], pp. 3-11). Boulez pays homage to Proust for being one of the first to understand this floating and transformable role of Wagnerian motifs. 54. The themes of speed and slowness are most extensively developed in *The Captive: * "To understand the emotions which they arouse, and which others even betterlooking do not, we must realise that they are not immobile, but in motion, and add to their person a sign corre sponding to that which in physics denotes speed... to such beings, such fugitive beings, their own nature and our anxiety fasten wings"; vol. 3 *oi Remembrance of Things Past, *trans.

For the preceding cases, what we must arrive at is an understanding of certain socalled neurotic behaviors as a function of becomings-animal, instead of relegating becomingsanimal to a psychoanalytic interpretation of behaviors. We saw this in relation to masochism (and Lolito explains that the origin of his feats lies in certain masochistic experiences; a fine text by Chris tian Maurel conjugates a becoming-monkey and a becoming-horse in a masochistic pairing). Anorexia would also have to be understood from the point of view of becominganimal. 59. See *Newsweek, *May 16, 1977, p. 57.   60.

Paul Ernest Joset clearly notes these two aspects of the secret initiatory society, the Mambela of the Congo: on the one hand, its relation of influence over the traditional political  leaders, which gets to the point of a transfer of social powers; and on the other hand, its de  facto relation with the Anioto, as a secret hindsociety of crime or leopardmen (even if the  Anioto are of another origin than the Mambela). See *Les societes secretes des  hommes-leopards en Afrique noire, *chapter 5. 78. On the psychoanalytic conceptions of the secret, see *Du secret, Nouvelle revue de * *psychanalyse, *no. 14 (Fall 1976); and for the evolution of Freud on this subject, the article by  Claude Girard, "Le secret aux origines," pp. 55-83. 79. Bernard Pingaud shows, on the basis of the exemplary text of Henry James, "The Figure in the Carpet" *[The Novels and Tales of Henry James *(New York: C. Scribner's Sons,  1907-1917), vol. 15—Trans.], how the secret jumps from content to form, and escapes both:  *Du secret, *pp. 247-249. This text has been frequently commented upon from the viewpoint of  psychoanalysis; above all, J.-B. Pontalis, *Apres Freud *(Paris: Gallimard, 1968). But psycho-  analysis remains prisoner to a necessarily disguised content and a necessarily symbolic form  (structure, absent cause ...), at a level that defines both the unconscious and language. That is  why, in its aesthetic or literary applications, it misses the secret *in *an author, as well as the  secret *oj*an author. The same goes for the secret of Oedipus: they concern themselves with the  first two kinds of secret but not with the second, which is nevertheless the most important. 80. On the fogginess of the idea of majority, see Kenneth Arrow's two famous themes, "the Condorcet effect" and the "theorem of collective decision." 81. See William Faulkner, *Intruder in the Dust (New *York: Vintage, 1948), p. 216. Speak ing of Southern whites after the Civil War (not only the poor but also the old monied families),  Faulkner writes, "We are in the position of the German after 1933 who had no other alterna-  tive but to be a Nazi or a Jew." 82. The subordination of the line to the point is clearly evident in the arborescent schemas: see Julien Pacotte, *Le reseau arborescent, scheme primordial de la pensee *(Paris:  Hermann, 1936), and the status of centered or hierarchical systems according to Pierre  Rosenthiehl and Jean Petitot, "Automate asocial et systemes acentres," *Communications, *no.  22 (1974), pp. 45-62. The arborescent schema of majority could be presented as follows: 83. A line of becoming, in relation to the localizable connection of A and B (distance), or in relation to their contiguity:

The same thing applies to the works of Kafka, in which childhood blocks function as the opposite  of childhood memories. Proust's case is more complicated because he performs a mixture of  the two. The situation of the psychoanalyst is to grasp memories or phantasies, but never  childhood blocks. 85. For example, in the system of memory, the formation of a memory implies a diago nal that turns present A into representation A' in relation to the new present B, and into A" in  relation to C, etc.: order of time See Edmund Husserl, *The Phenomenology of Internal Time-Consciousness, *ed. Martin Heidegger, trans. James S. Churchill, intro. Calvin O. Schrag (Bloomington: Indiana Univer sity Press, 1964), pp. 48-50. 86. Friedrich Nietzsche, *Untimely Meditations, *trans. R. J. Hollingdale (New York: Cambridge University Press, 1983), "On the Uses and Disadvantages of History for Life," sec. 1, pp. 63-64. 87. On all of these themes, see Pierre Boulez. (1) On how transversals always tend to escape horizontal and vertical coordinates of music, sometimes even drawing "virtual lines," see *Notes of an Apprenticeship, *ed. Paule Thevenin, trans. Robert Weinstock (New York: Knopf, 1968), pp. 231 -232,295-301,382-383. (2) On the idea of the sound block or "block of duration," in relation to this transversal, see *Boulez on Music Today, *trans. Susan Bradshaw and Richard Bennett (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1971), pp. 55-59. (3) On the distinction between points and blocks, "punctual sets," and "aggregative sets" with vary ing individuality, see "Sonate que me veux-tu?", *Mediations, *no. 7 (1964). The hatred of memory appears frequently in Boulez; see "Eloge de l'amnesie," *Musique enjeu, *no. 4 (1971), pp. 5-14, and "J'ai horreur du souvenir," in *Roger Desormiere et son temps, *ed. Denise Mayer and Pierre Souvtchinsky (Monaco: Ed. du Rocher, 1966). Confining ourselves to contempo rary examples, one finds analogous declarations in Stravinsky, Cage, Berio. Of course, there is a musical memory that is tied to coordinates and is exercised in social settings (getting up, going to bed, beating a retreat). But the perception of a musical "phrase" appeals less to mem ory, even of the reminiscence type, than to an extension or contraction of perception of the encounter type. It should be studied how each musician sets in motion veritable *blocks of for-  getting: *for example, what Jean Barraque calls "slices of forgetting" and "absent develop ments" in the work of Debussy; *Debussy *(Paris: Seuil, 1977), pp. 169-171.

Hall, 1982), pp. 524-700; and Paul  Klee, *On Modern Art, *trans. Paul Findlay, intro. Herbert Reed (London: Faber, 1966). The  aim of statements like those of Mondrian on the exclusive value of the vertical and the hori-  zontal is to show the conditions under which the vertical and horizontal are sufficient to cre-  ate a transversal, which does not even have to be drawn; for example, coordinates of unequal  thickness intersect inside the frame and extend outside the frame, opening a "dynamic axis"  running transversally (see Michel Butor's comments in *Repertoire *[Paris: Minuit, 1960- ], vol.  3, "Le carre et son habitant"). One can also consult Michel Fried's article on Pollock's line,  *Three American Painters *(Cambridge, Mass.: Fogg Art Museum, 1965), and Henry Miller's  discussion of Nash's line, *On Turning Eighty *(London: Village Press, 1973). 90. "There was something tense, exasperated to the point of intolerable anger, in his good-humored breast, as he played the finely-spun peace-music. The more exquisite the  music, the more perfectly he produced it, in sheer bliss; and at the same time, the more intense  was the maddened exasperation within him"; D. H. Lawrence, *Aaron's Rod *(New York:  Thomas Seltzer, 1922), p. 16. 91. Although Luciano Berio indicates otherwise, it seems to us that his work, *Visage, *is composed according to the three states of faciality: first, a multiplicity of sound bodies and  silhouettes, then a short symphonic and dominant organization of the face, and finally a  launching of probe-heads in all directions. However, there is no question here of music "imi-  tating" the face and its avatars, or of the voice constituting a metaphor. Instead, the sounds  accelerate the deterritorialization of the face, giving it a properly acoustical power, and the  face reacts musically by in turn inducing a deterritorialization of the voice. This is a molecu-  lar face, produced by electronic music. The voice precedes the face, itself forms the face for  an instant, and outlives it, increasing in speed—on the condition that it is unarticulated,  asignifying, asubjective. 92. Will Grohman, *Paul Klee *(New York: Harry N. Abrams, n.d.): "Somewhat paradoxi cally he remarked that perhaps it had been his good fortune to develop painting, at least on the  formal plane, to the stage reached in music by Mozart" (p. 71). 93. Dominique Fernandez, *La rose des Tudors *(Paris: Julliard, 1976) (and the novel *Porporino *[Paris: Grasset, 1974]). Fernandez cites pop music as a timid return to great English  vocal music. It would be necessary to take into consideration techniques of circular breathing,  in which one sings breathing in as well as out, or of sound filtering using zones of resonance  (nose, forehead, cheekbones—a properly musical use of the face). 94. Marcel More, *Le dieu Mozart et le monde des oiseaux *(Paris: Gallimard, 1971).   95. As we have seen, imitation can be conceived either as a resemblance of terms culmi nating in an archetype (series), or as a correspondence of relations constituting a symbolic  order (structure); but becoming is not reducible to either of these. The concept of mimesis is  not only inadequate, it is radically false. 96. Francois Truffaut, *Hitchcock(New *York: Simon and Schuster, 1967): "I took the dra matic licence of not having the birds scream at all" (p. 224). 97. See Ernesto de Martino, *La terredu remords *(Paris: Gallimard, 1966), pp. 142-170. Martino, however, retains an interpretation based on the archetype, imitation, and  identification. 98. Jean Claude *Larouche, Alexis le trotteur *(Montreal: Ed. du Jour, 1971). They quote this account: "He didn't play music with his mouth like one of us; he had a huge harmonica we  couldn't even play. ... When he played with us, he would decide all of a sudden to double us.  In other words, he doubled the beat; in the time we played one beat, he played two, which  required extraordinary wind" (p. 95).

Andre Tetry, *Les outils chez les etres vivants *(Paris: Gallimard, 1948), the chapter on "musical instruments," with bibliography. An animal's movement or labor may make noise,  but we speak of a musical instrument whenever animals use apparatuses whose sole function  is to produce various sounds (the musical character, to the extent that it is determinable, is  quite variable, as is the case with the vocal apparatus of birds; there are veritable virtuosos  among insects). From this standpoint, we distinguish: (1) stridulatory apparatuses, of the  stringed instrument type: the rubbing of a rigid surface against another surface (insects, crus-  taceans, spiders, scorpions, pedipalps); (2) percussive apparatuses, of the drum, cymbal, or  xylophone type: direct application of muscles to a vibratory membrane (crickets and certain  fish). Not only is there an infinite variety of apparatuses and sounds, but the same animal  varies its rhythm, tonality, intensity according to still more mysterious urgencies. "It then be-  comes a song of anger, anxiety, fear, triumph, love. When there is keen excitation, the rhythm  of the stridulation varies: in *Crioceris lilii, *the frequency of the rubbing goes from 228 strokes  per minute to 550 or more." 102.

Eibl-Eibesfeldt, however, interprets the grass-stem behavior as a vestige. 26. See *L'Odyss'ee sous-marine de I'equipe Cousteau, *film no. 36, *La marche des * *langoustes *(L. R. A.), commentary by Cousteau-Diole: spiny lobsters along the northern coast of the Yucatan Peninsula sometimes leave their territories. They assemble, at first in small groups, before the first winter storm, and before any sign detectable by human instruments. When the storm comes, they form long march processions, in single file, with a leader that is periodically relieved and a rearguard (the speed of the march is five-eighths of a mile per hour, for sixty miles or more). This migration does not seem to be associated with egg laying, which does not take place until six months later. Hernnkind, a lobster specialist, hypothesizes that this is a "vestige" from the last ice age (more than 10,000 years ago). Cousteau leans toward a more current interpretation, even mentioning the possibility that it is a premonition of a new ice age. The factual issue is that in this exceptional case the lobsters' territorial assemblage opens onto a social assemblage, and that this social assemblage is connected to cosmic forces, or, as Cousteau says, "pulsations of the earth." But "the enigma remains entirely unsolved," all the more so because this lobster procession occasions a slaughter by fishermen, and also because lobsters cannot be tagged since they shed their shells. 27. The best book of nursery rhymes, and on nursery rhymes, seems to be *Les complines * *de langue francaise, *with the commentary by editors Jean Beaucomot, Franck Guibat, et al. (Paris: Seghers, 1970). The territorial character of nursery rhymes appears in such privileged examples as "Pimpanicaille," two distinct versions of which exist in Gruyeres on "the two sides of the street" (pp. 27-28); but it is a nursery rhyme in the strict sense only when there is a distribution of specialized roles in a game, and the formation of an autonomous game assem blage that reorganizes the territory. 28. Nikolaas Tinbergen, *The Study of Instinct *(Oxford: The Clarendon Press, 1969). 29. On the one hand, the experiments of W. R. Hess have shown that there is not a cere bral center but instead points that are concentrated in one zone and disseminated in another, and are capable of inciting the same effect; conversely, the effect may change according to the duration and intensity of the excitation of a point. On the other hand, E. von Hoist's experi ments on "deafferented" fish demonstrate the importance of central nervous coordination in fin rhythms; Tinbergen's schema takes these interactions into account only secondarily. The hypothesis of a "population of oscillators" or a "pack of oscillating molecules" forming sys tems of articulation from the inside, independent of any common measure, is most compel ling in view of the problem of circadian rhythms. See A. Reinberg, "La chronobiologie,"  *Sciences, *vol. 1(1970); and T. van den Dreissche and A. Reinberg, "Rythmes biologiques," in  *Encyclopedia Universalis, *vol. 14, p. 572: "It does not seem possible to reduce the mechanism of circadian rhythmicity to a simple sequence of elementary processes." 30.

The participation of a black hole in an assemblage appears in numerous examples of inhibition, or fascination-ecstasy, notably in the peacock: "The male peacock spreads his tail  feathers.... Then he bends the spread-out tail forward and points downward with his beak,  while his head is still upright. As a result, the female runs in front of him and pecks in a search-  ing manner on the ground in the focal point of the concave mirrorlike shape of the fanned tail.  The male peacock points, so to speak, with his fanned-out tail toward imaginary food,"  Eibl-Eibesfeldt, *Ethology, *p. 116\.

"The people in Mussorgsky's *Boris *do not form a true crowd; at times one group sings, then another, and then a third, each in turn, and most often in unison.

Quoted by Jean Barraque, *Debussy *(Paris: Seuil, 1977), p. 159. This problem—how to do a  crowd—obviously recurs in other arts also, painting, cinema, etc. One may refer in particular  to the films of Eisenstein, which proceed by this type of very special group individuation. 49.

In his book on Debussy, Barraque analyzes the "dialogue of the wind and the sea" in terms offerees instead of themes: pp. 153-154. See Messiaen's statements on his own works: sounds are no longer anything more "than vulgar means of expression intended to make dura tions measurable." 52. Odile Vivier describes Varese's procedures for treating sound matter, in *Varese *(Paris: Seuil, 1973): the use of pure sounds acting as a prism (p. 36); mechanisms of projection onto a plane (pp. 45 and 50); non-octave-forming scales (p. 75); the "ionization" procedure (pp. 98ff.); the theme of sound *molecules, *the transformations of which are determined by forces or energies *(passim).* 53. See the interview with Stockhausen on the role of synthesizers and the effectively "cosmic" dimension of music, in *Le Monde, *July 21,1977: "Work with very limited materials and integrate the universe into them through a continuous variation." Richard Pinhas has written an excellent analysis of the possibilities of synthesizers in this regard, in relation to pop music: "Input, Output," *in Atem, *no. 10 (1977). 54. The definition of fuzzy aggregates brings up all kinds of problems because one cannot appeal to a local determination: "The set of all objects on this table" is obviously not a fuzzy set. Mathematicians concerned with the question speak only of "fuzzy subsets" because the reference set must always be an ordinary set. See Arnold Kaufmann, *Introduction to the The-  ory of Fuzzy Subsets, *foreword L. A. Zadeh, trans. D. L. Swanson (New York: Academic Press, 1975), and Hourya Sinacoeur, "Logique et mathematique du flou," *Critique, *no. 372 (May 1978), pp. 512-525. In considering fuzziness as the characteristic of certain sets, our point of departure was a functional, as opposed to a local, definition: sets of heterogeneous elements that have a territorial, or rather territorializing, function. But this is a nominal definitiion that does not take "what happened" into account. The real definition can come only at the level of processes affecting the fuzzy set; a set is fuzzy if its elements belong to it only by virtue of spe cific operations of consistency and consolidation, which themselves follow a special logic. 55. Paul Klee, *On Modern Art, *p. 53: "The legend of the childishness of my drawing must have originated from those linear compositions of mine in which I tried to combine a concrete image, say that of a man, with the pure representation of the linear element. Had I wished to present man 'as he is,' then I should have had to use such a bewildering confusion of lines that pure elementary representation would have been out of the question. The result would have been vagueness beyond recognition." 56. Paul Virilio, *L'insecurite du territoire *(Paris: Stock, 1975), p. 49\. Henry Miller devel ops this theme in *The Time of the Assassins. A Study ofRimbaud*(Norfolk, Conn.: J. Laughlin, 1956), and in the text he wrote for Varese, "Lost! Saved!" *(The AirConditioned Nightmare * [New York: New Directions, 1945]). It is undoubtedly Miller who has taken the modern figure of the writer as cosmic artisan the farthest, particularly in *Sexus.* 57. On the relation of colors to sound, see Messiaen and Samuel, *Conversations, *pp. 15-17. Messiaen faults drug users for oversimplifying the relation, which they make into a relation between a noise and a color, instead of isolating complexes of sounds-durations and complexes of colors. 58.

Popular music is melody, in its fullest sense, melody persuading us that it is  self-sufficient and is in fact synonymous with music itself. How could it not refuse to bend to  the learned development of a musical work pursuing its own ends? Many symphonies inspired  by folklore are only symphonies *about *a popular theme, to which the learned  development remains alien and exterior. The popular melody could never constitute a true  theme; and that is why, in popular music, the melody is the entire work, and why once it is  over it has no other resource than to repeat itself. But can't the melody transform itself into  a theme? Bartok solves this problem, which was thought insoluble" (p. 1056). 60.

In the last text, Clastres depicts the destiny of the warrior in  primitive society and analyzes the mechanism that prevents the concentration of power  (in the same way that Mauss demonstrated that the potlatch was a mechanism preventing  the concentration of wealth). 13. Jacques Meunier, *Les gaminsde Bogota *(Paris: Lattes, 1977), p. 159 ("blackmail for dispersion") and p. 17 7: if necessary, "it is the other street children who, by means of a compli-  cated interplay of humiliations and silence, get the idea across that he must leave the gang."  Meunier emphasizes the degree to which the fate of the ex-gang member is jeopardized: not  only for health reasons, but because he finds it hard to integrate himself into the criminal  underworld, a society too hierarchical, too centralized, too centered on organs of power for  him to fit into (p. 178). On child gangs, see also the novel by Jorge Amado, *Capitaes de areia  *(Sao Paolo: Livraria Martins, 1944). 14. See I. S. Bernstein, "La dominance sociale chez les primates" in *La Recherche, *no. 91 (July 1978). 15. Clastres, *Society against the State, *p. 169: "The emergence of the State brought about the great typological division between Savage and Civilized man; it created the unbridgeable  gulf whereby everything was changed, for, on the other side, Time became History." In order  to account for this emergence, Clastres cites first a demographic factor ("but there is no ques-  tion of replacing an economic determinism with a demographic determinism"; p. 180), then  the possibility of a warring machine (?) running amok; he also cites, more unexpectedly, the  indirect role of a certain mode *of prophetic speech, *which, directed first against the "chiefs,"  produces a formidable new kind of power. But one obviously cannot prejudge more elabo-  rated solutions Clastres might have found for this problem. On the possible role of prophetic  speech, refer to Helene Clastres, *La terre sans mal, le prophetisme tupiguarani *(Paris: Edi-  tions du Seuil, 1975). 16.

[ TRANS : According to Serres, the *clinamen, *or declination of the atom, is the "mini mal angle leading to the formation of a vortex, and appears by chance in a laminar flow" *(La  naissance de la physique, *p. 14). The *clinamen *is the angle between a curve and its tangent, or  "the smallest [angle] one can make, preventing anything from coming between the two lines  which form it.... In other words, the angle appears at the same time as curvature" (p. 18).  "The *clinamen *is a differential" (p. 11).] 18.

Greek geometry is thoroughly marked by the opposition between these two poles, the theorematic and problematic, and by the relative triumph of the former: in his *Commen-  tary of the First Book of Euclid's Elements, *trans, and intro. Glenn R. Murrow (Princeton,  N.J.: Princeton University Press, 1970), Proclus analyzes the difference between the poles,  taking the Speusippus-Menaechmus opposition as an example. Mathematics has always been  marked by this tension also; for example, the axiomatic element has confronted a proble-  matic, "intuitionist," or "constructivist" current emphasizing a calculus of problems very dif-  ferent from axiomatics, or any theorematic approach. See Georges Bouligand, *Le d'eclin des  absolus mathematico-logiques *(Paris: Ed. d'Enseignement Superieur, 1949). 22. Paul Virilio, *L'insecurite du territoire *(Paris: Stock, 1975), p. 120: "We know that the youth of geometry, geometry as free, creative investigation, came to an end with Ar-  chimedes. . .. The sword of a Roman soldier cut the thread, tradition says. In killing geo-  metrical creation, the Roman State lay the foundation for the geometrical imperialism of  the West." 23. With Monge, and especially Poncelet, the limits of sensible, or even spatial, repre sentation (striated space) are indeed surpassed, but less in the direction of a symbolic power  *(puissance) *of abstraction than toward a transspatial imagination, or a transintuition (conti-  nuity). See Leon Brunschvicg's commentary on Poncelet, *Les etapes de la philosophic  mathematique *(Paris: PUF, 1947). 24. Michel Serres *(La naissance de la physique, *pp. 105-107) analyzes the opposition d'Alembert-Bernoulli from this point of view. More generally, what is at issue is the difference  between two models of space: "In the Mediterranean basin there is a shortage of water, and he  who harnesses water rules. Hence that world of physics in which the conduit is essential, and  the *clinamen *seems like freedom because it is precisely a turbulence that rejects forced flow.  Incomprehensible to scientific theory, incomprehensible to the master of the waters....  Hence the great figure of Archimedes: the master of floating bodies and military machines"  (p. 106). 2 5.

Mary Elizabeth Meek (Coral Gables, Fla.: University of Miami  Press, 1971), pp. 281-288. This text, often considered decisive, seems ambiguous to us  because it invokes Democritus and atomism without dealing with the hydraulic question, and  because it treats rhythm as a "secondary specialization" of the form of the body (p. 286). 26.

Franz Rosenthal (Princeton, N J.: Princeton University Press, 1967). One of the essential themes of this masterpiece is the sociological problem of the esprit de corps, and its ambiguity. Ibn Khaldun contrasts bedouinism (the bedouin life-style, not the ethnic group) with sedentarity or city living. The first aspect of this opposition is the inverted relation between the public and the secret: not only is there a secrecy of the bedouin war machine, as opposed to the publicity of the State city dweller, but in the first case "eminence" is based on a secret solidarity, while in the second case the secret is subordinated to the demands of social eminence. Second, bedouinism brings into play both a great purity and a great mobility of the lineages and their genealogy, whereas city life makes for lineages that are very impure, and at the same time rigid and fixed: Solidarity has a different meaning at either pole. Third, and this is the main point, bedouin lineages mobilize an esprit de corps and integrate into it, as a new dimension: this is  *asablyah, *or *ikhtilat, *from which the Arabic word for socialism is derived (Ibn Khaldun stresses the absence of any "power" residing in the tribal chief, who has no State constraints at his disposal). On the other hand, in city living the esprit de corps becomes a dimension of power and is adapted for "autocracy." 32. The principal texts of Husserl are *Ideas, *trans. W. R.

Hayes, 1978) (with Derrida's very important commentary, pp. 118-132). On the issue of a vague yet rigorous sci ence, we may refer to the formula of Michel Serres, in his commentary on the geometrical fig ure called the *salinon: *"It is rigorous, anexact. And not precise, exact or inexact. Only a metrics is exact" *(Naissance de la physique, *p. 29). Gaston Bachelard's book *Essai sur la  connaissance approch'ee *(Paris: Vrin, 1927) remains the best study of the steps and procedures constituting a rigor of the anexact, and of their creative role in science. 33. Gilbert Simondon has contributed much to the analysis and critique of the hylo-morphic schema and of its social presuppositions ("form corresponds to what the man in command has thought to himself, and must express in a positive manner when he gives his orders: form is thus of the order of the expressible"). To the formmatter schema, Simondon opposes a dynamic schema, that of matter endowed with singularitiesforces, or the energetic conditions at the basis of a system. The result is an entirely different conception of the relations between science and technology. See *L'individu et sa genese  physico-biologique *(Paris: PUF, 1964). 34. In *Timaeus, *28-29, Plato entertains for an instant the thought that Becoming is not simply the inevitable characteristic of copies or reproductions, but could itself be a model rivaling the Identical and the Uniform. He states this hypothesis only in order to reject it; for it is true that if becoming is a model, not only must the duality of the model and the copy, of the model and reproduction, disappear, but the very notions of model and reproduction tend to lose all meaning, [ TRANS : Deleuze develops this point in "Plato and the Simulacrum," trans.

Monge is a typical example; he began by grouping heat, light, and electricity as "variable affections of bodies," the concern of "specific physics," while general physics would deal with extension, gravity, and movement. It was only later that Monge unified all of the fields under general physics (Anne Querrien). 37. Serres, *La naissance de la physique, *p. 65. 38. Carlos Castaneda, *The Teachings of Don Juan *(Berkeley: University of California Press, 1971), p. 88. 39. Albert Lautman has shown quite clearly how Riemann spaces, for example, admit a Euclidean conjunction making it possible at all times to define the parallelism of two neigh boring vectors; this being the case, instead of exploring a multiplicity by legwork, the multipli city is treated as though "immersed in a Euclidean space with a sufficient number of dimensions." See *Les sch'emas de structure *(Paris: Hermann, 1938), pp. 23-24, 43-47. 40. In Bergson, the relations between intuition and intelligence are very complex, and they are in perpetual interaction. Bouligand's theme is also relevant here: the dualism of the two mathematical elements, the "problem" and the "global synthesis," is developed only when they enter a field of interaction in which the global synthesis defines the "categories" without which the problem would have no general solution. See *Le d'eclin des absolus  math'ematico-logiques.* 41. Marcel Detienne, in *Les maitres de v'erit'e dans la Grece archdique *(Paris: Maspero, 1973), clearly articulates these two poles of thought, which correspond to the two aspects of sovereignty according to Dumezil: the magico-religious speech of the despot or of the "old man of the sea," and the dialogue-speech of the city. Not only are the principal character types of Greek thought (the Poet, the Physicist, the Philosopher, the Sophist, etc.) situated in rela tion to these poles, but Detienne interposes between the two poles a distinct group, the Warri ors, which brings about transition or evolution. 42. There exists a Hegelianism of the right that lives on in official political philosophy and weds the destiny of thought to the State. Alexandre Kojeve ("Tyranny and Wisdom," in Leo Strauss, *On Tyranny *[New York: Free Press of Glencoe, 1963]) and Eric Weil *(Hegel et  I'Etat. Philosophiepolitique *[Paris: Vrin, 1974]) are its recent representatives. From Hegel to Max Weber there developed a whole line of reflection on the relation of the modern State to Reason, both as rational-technical and as reasonable-human. If it is objected that this ration ality, already present in the archaic imperial State, is the *optimum *of the governors them selves, the Hegelians respond that the rational-reasonable cannot exist without a minimum of participation by everybody. The question, rather, is whether the very form of the rational-reasonable is not extracted from the State, in a way that necessarily makes it right, gives it "reason" *(lui donner necessairement "raison").* 43.

Anny Milovanoff, "La seconde peau du nomade," *Nouvelles litt'eraires, *no. 2646 (July 27, 1978), p. 18: "The Larbaa nomads, on the border of the Algerian Sahara, use the word *triga, *which generally means road or way, to designate the woven straps serving to rein force the cords holding the tent to the stakes.... In nomad thought, the dwelling is tied not to a territory but rather to an itinerary. Refusing to take possession of the land they cross, the nomads construct an environment out of wool and goat hair, one that leaves no mark at the temporary site it occupies.... Thus wool, a soft material, gives nomad life its unity.... Nomads pause at the representation of their journeys, not at a figuration of the space they cross. They leave space to space.... Woolly polymorphism." 50. See W. Montgomery Watt, *Mohammed at Medina *(London: Oxford University Press, 1956), pp. 85-86, 242. 51. Emmanuel Laroche, *Histoire de la ratine "Nem " en grec ancien *(Paris: Klincksieck, 1949). The root "Nem" indicates distribution, not allocation, even when the two are linked. In the pastoral sense, the distribution of animals is effected in a nonlimited space and implies no parceling out of land: "The occupation of shepherd, in the Homeric age, had nothing to do with a parceling of land; when the agrarian question came to the foreground, in the time of Solon, it was expressed in an entirely different vocabulary." *To take to pasture *(nemo) refers not to a parceling out but to a scattering, to a repartition of animals. It was only after Solon that Nomos came to designate the principle at the basis of the laws and of right (Thesmo'i and Dike), and then came to be identified with the laws themselves. Prior to that, there was instead an alternative between the city, or polis, ruled by laws, and the outskirts as the place of the nomos. A similar alternative is found in the work of Ibn Khaldun: between *hadara *as city liv ing, and *badiya *as nomos (not the town, but the preurban countryside, the plateau, steppe, mountain, or desert). 52.

558 D NOTES TO PP. 384-386 changes in course, the pauses, the detours were an integral part of the Crusade: "this army of crusaders that we envision as a modern army, like those of Louis XIV or Napoleon, marching with absolute passivity, obeying the will of a diplomatic officer and staff. Such an army knows where it is going, and when it makes a mistake, it is not for lack of reflection. A history more attentive to differences accepts a more realistic image of the army of the Crusade. The army of the Crusade was freely, sometimes anarchically alive. ... This army was motivated from within, as a function of a complex coherence by virtue of which nothing happened by chance. It is certain that the conquest of Constantinople had its reason, necessity and a religious char acter, like the other deeds of the Crusades" (vol. 2, p. 7). Alphandery shows in particular that the idea of a battle against the Infidel, *at any point, *appeared early on, along with the idea of liberating the Holy Land (vol. 1, p. 219). 60. Modern historians have been inspired to fine analyses by this confrontation between the East and the West, which began in the Middle Ages (and is tied to the question, Why did capitalism develop in the West and not elsewhere?). See especially Fernand Braudel, *Capital-  ism and Material Life, 1400-1800, *trans. Miriam Kochan (New York: Harper and Row, 1967), pp. 97-108; Pierre Chaunu, *L'expansion europeenne du Xllle au XVe siecle *(Paris: PUF, 1969), pp. 334-339 ("Why Europe? Why not China?"); Maurice Lombard, *Espaces et reseaux  du hautMoyen Age *(The Hague: Mouton, 1971), chapter 8 (and p. 219: "What is called defor estation in the East is named clearing in the West. The first deep cause of the shift of the domi nant centers from the East to the West is therefore a geographical reason: forest-clearing proved to have more potential than desert-oasis"). 61. Marx's observations on the despotic formations of Asia have been confirmed by the African analyses of Max Gluckman, *Custom and Conflict in Africa *(Glencoe, 111.: Free Press, 1959): at the same time immutability of form and constant rebellion. The idea of a "transfor mation" of the State indeed seems to be a Western one. And that other idea, the "destruction" of the State, belongs much more to the East and to the conditions of a nomad war machine. Attempts have been made to present the two ideas as successive phases of revolution, but there are too many differences between them and they are difficult to reconcile; they reflect the opposition between the socialist and anarchist currents of the nineteenth century. The Western proletariat itself is perceived from two points of view: as having to seize power and transform the State apparatus (the point of view of labor power), and as willing or wishing for the destruction of the State (this time, the point of view of nomadization power). Even Marx defines the proletariat not only as alienated (labor) but as deterritorialized. The proletariat, in this second perspective, appears as the heir to the nomad in the Western world. Not only did many anarchists invoke nomadic themes originating in the East, but the bourgeoisie above all were quick to equate proletarians and nomads, comparing Paris to a city haunted by nomads (see Louis Chevalier, *Laboring Classes and Dangerous Classes in Paris during the First Half of  the Nineteenth Century, *trans. Frank Jellenck [New York: H. Fertig, 1973], pp. 362-366). 62. See Lucien Musset, *Les invasions.

Virilio concludes that the issue is less confinement than the management of the public ways, or the control of movement.

Virilio gives a very good definition of the fleet in being and its historical conse quences: "The fleet in being... is the permanent presence in the sea of an invisible fleet able  to strike no matter where and no matter when ... it is a new idea of violence that no longer  comes from direct confrontation... but rather from the unequal properties of bodies, evalu-  ation of the number of movements allowed them in a chosen element, permanent verification  of their dynamic efficiency... .Henceforth it is no longer a question of crossing a continent or  an ocean from one city to the next, one shore to the next. The fleet in being creates ... the  notion of displacement without destination in space and time.... The strategic submarine  has no need to go anywhere in particular; it is content, while controlling the sea, to remain  invisible . .. the realization of the absolute, uninterrupted, circular voyage, since it involves  neither departure nor arrival... .If, as Lenin claimed,'strategy means choosing which points  we apply force to,' we must admit that these 'points', today, are no longer geostrategic  strongpoints, since from any given spot we can now reach any other, no matter where it might  be... *geographic localization *seems to have definitively lost its strategic value, and, inversely,  that this same value is attributed to the *delocalization of the vector, *of a vector in permanent  movement"; *Speed and Politics, *pp. 38,40-41,134-135. Virilio's texts are of great importance  and originality in every respect. The only point that presents a difficulty for us is his assimila-  tion of three groups of speed that seem very different to us: (1) speeds of nomadic, or revolu-  tionary, tendency (riot, guerrilla warfare); (2) speeds that are regulated, converted, appropri-  ated by the State apparatus (management of the public ways); (3) speeds that are reinstated by  a worldwide organization of total war, or planetary overarmament (from the fleet in being to  nuclear strategy). Virilio tends to equate these groups on account of their interactions and  makes a general case for the "fascist" character of speed. It is, nevertheless, his own analyses  that make these distinctions possible. 66. Jean-Pierre Vernant in particular has analyzed the connection between the Greek city-state and a homogeneous geometrical extension, *Mythe et pensee chez les Grecs *(Paris:  Maspero, 1971 -1974), vol. 1, part 3\. The problem is necessarily more complicated in relation  to the archaic empires, or in relation to formations subsequent to the classical city-state. That  is because the space in question is very different. But it is still the case that the number is sub-  ordinated to space, as Vernant suggests with regard to Plato's ideal state. The Pythagorean or  Neoplatonic conceptions of number envelop imperial astronomical spaces of a type other  than homogeneous extension, but they maintain the subordination of the number; that is why  Numbers become *ideal, *but not strictly speaking "numbering." 67. Dumezil stresses the role played by the arithmetic element in the earliest forms of political sovereignty. He even tends to make it a third pole of sovereignty. See *Servius et la For-  tune *and *Le troisieme souverain *(Paris: Maisonneuve, 1949). But the role of this arithmetic  element is, rather, to organize a matter; in so doing it submits that matter to one or the other of  the two principal poles. 68. Karl von Clausewitz stresses the secondary role of geometry, in tactics and in strat egy: *On War, *trans. Michael Howard, Peter Paret, and Bernard Brodie (Princeton, N. J.:  Princeton University Press, 1976), pp. 214-216 ("The Geometrical Factor"). 69.

The term used by Vladimirtsov, "antrustions," is borrowed from the Saxon regime, in which the king's *company, *or "trust," was composed of Franks. 72. A particularly interesting case is that of a special body of smiths among the Tuareg, called the *Enaden *(the "Others"); the Enaden are thought to have been originally Sudanese slaves, Jewish settlers in the Sahara, or descendants of the knights of Saint Louis. See Rene Pottier, "Les artisans sahariens du metal chez les Touareg," in *Techniques et civilisations, *vol. 1 *(M'etaux et civilisations), *no. 2 (1945), pp. 31-40. 73. Feudalism is no less a military system than so-called military democracy; but both systems assume an army integrated into some kind of State apparatus (for feudalism, it was the Carolingian land reform). It is Vladimirtsov who developed a feudal interpretation of the nomads of the steppe, whereas Mikhail Griaznov, *The Ancient Civilization of Southern  Siberia, *trans. James Hogarth (New York: Cowles, 1969), leans toward military democracy. But one of Vladimirtsov's main arguments is that the organization of the nomads becomes feudal precisely to the extent that it is in disintegration, or is integrated into the empires it conquers. He himself remarks that in the beginning the Mongols did not organize the seden tary land they took over into fiefs, true or false. 74. J. F. C.

Virilio, however, asserts that there was an indirect transition from hunting to war: when women served as "portage or pack" animals, which already enabled the hunters to enter into a relation of "homosexual duel" transcending the hunt. But it seems that Virilio himself invites us to make a distinction between *speed, *as projector and projectile, and *displacement, *as transport and portage. The war machine is defined from the first point of view, while the sec ond relates to the public sphere. The horse, for example, is not a part of the war machine if it serves only to transport men who dismount to do battle. The war machine is defined by action, not transport, even if the transport reacts upon the action. 76. J. F. C. Fuller, *Armaments and History, *pp. 137ff., shows that the First World War was first conceived as an offensive war of movement based on artillery. But artillery was turned against artillery, forcing immobility. It was not possible to reinstate mobility in the war through "ever-increasing shell fire" (p. 138) since the craters made the terrain all the harder to negotiate. The solution, to which the English, and General Fuller in particular, made decisive contributions, came in the form of the tank: the tank, a "landship" (p. 139), reconstituted a kind of maritime or smooth space on land, and "superimposed naval tactics on land warfare" (p. 140). As a general rule, military response is never in kind: the tank was the response to artil lery, the helicopter to the tank, etc. This makes for an innovation factor in the war machine that is very different from innovation in the work machine. 77. On this general distinction between the two models, "work-free action," "consum ing force/conserving force," "real effect/formal effect," etc., see Martial Gueroult's expo sition, *Dynamique et metaphysique leibniziennes *(Paris: Les Belles Lettres, 1934), pp. 55, 119 ff., 222-224. 78.

This enables Braudel to conclude: "The tool, according to this theory, is the result and no longer the cause"; *Capitalism and Material Life, *p. 116. 80. Treatises on martial arts remind us that the Ways, which are still subject to the laws of gravity, must be transcended in the void. Kleist's *About Marionettes, *trans. Michael Lebeck (Mindelheim: Three Kings Press, 1970), without question one of the most spontaneously ori ental texts in Western literature, presents a similar movement: the linear displacement of the center of gravity is still "mechanical" and relates to something more "mysterious" that con cerns the soul and knows nothing of weight. 81. See Paul Pelliot, "Les systemes d'ecriture en usage chez les anciens Mongols," *Asia * *Major *2 (1925), pp. 284-289: The Mongols used the Uighur script, with the Syriac alphabet (it was the Tibetans who produced a phonetic theory of Uighur writing); the two versions of the  *Secret History of the Mongols *that have been passed down to us are a Chinese translation and a phonetic transcription in Chinese characters. 82.

There are, of course, forms of cooking and architecture that are part of the nomad war machine, but they fall under a different "trait," one distinguishing them from their seden tary form. Nomad architecture, for example, the Eskimo igloo orthe Hunnish wooden palace, is a derivative of the tent: its influence on sedentary art came by way of domes and half-domes, and above all of *space starting very low, *as in a tent. As for nomad cooking, it consists literally of break-fast (the paschal tradition is nomadic). And it is under this trait that it can be part of a war machine: for example, the Janissaries used a cooking pot as their rallying point; there were different ranks of cooks, and their hat had a wooden spoon through it. 85. Itisinthe *Trait'edu rebelle *(Paris: Bourgois, 1981) that Jiinger takes his clearest stand against national socialism and develops certain points contained in *Der Arbeiter: *a concep tion of the "line" as an active escape passing between the two figures of the old Soldier and the modern Worker, carrying both toward another destiny in another assembly (nothing of this remains in Heidegger's notion of the Line, although it is dedicated to Jiinger). 86. Lynn White, Jr., who is actually not inclined to ascribe much power of innovation to the nomads, sometimes establishes extensive technological lineages with surprising origins: he traces hot-air and turbine technologies to Malaya *(Medieval Technology and  Social Change, *p. 95 and note): "Thus a chain of technological stimuli may be traced back from some of the major figures of early modern science and technology through the later Middle Ages to the jungles of Malaya. A second, and related, Malay invention, the fire pis ton, may have had significant influence upon the European understanding of air pressure and its applications." 87. On the particularly thorny question of the stirrup, see Lynn White, Jr., *Medieval * *Technology and Social Change, *chapter 1. 88. See the fine article by A.

In particular, *damasking (damassage), *which does not come from Damascus at all, but rather from the Greek or Persian word for diamond, designates the treatment of cast steel that makes it as hard as a diamond and the designs in this steel resulting from the crystallization of the cement ("true damask was made in the centers

But on the other hand, *damascening  (damasquinage), *which did come from Damascus, designates only inlay in metal (or in fab ric), intentional designs imitating damasking using entirely different means. 91. Andre Leroi-Gourhan, *Milieu et techniques *(Paris: Albin Michel, 1945), pp. 356ff. Gilbert Simondon, discussing short series, takes up the question of the "absolute origins of a technological lineage," or of the creation of a "technical essence": *Du mode d'existence des  objects techniques *(Paris: Aubier, 1969), pp. 41-49. 92. On the mold-modulation relation, and the way in which molding hides or contracts an operation of modulation that is essential to matter-movement, see Simondon, *Du mode  d'existence, *pp. 2 8-50 ("modulation is molding in a continuous and perpetually variable man ner"; p. 42). Simondon clearly shows that the hylomorphic schema owes its power not to the technological operation but to the social model of *work *subsuming that operation (pp. 47-49). 93. Simondon feels no special attraction for the problems of metallurgy. His analysis is not, in fact, historical and prefers to deal with examples drawn from electronics. But, histori cally, there is no electronics without metallurgy. Thus Simondon pays homage to metallurgy: "Metallurgy does not entirely accommodate itself to an analysis using the hylomorphic schema. The fixing of the form is not accomplished visibly in a single stroke, but in several successive operations; the forging and quenching of steel are anterior and posterior, respec tively, to the fixing of the form in the strict sense; forging and quenching are, nevertheless, operations that constitute objects" *(L'individu, *p. 59). 94. Not only must myths be taken into account, but also positive history, for example, the role of "the brass" in the evolution of musical form; or again, the constitution of a "metal lic synthesis" in electronic music (Richard Pinhas). 95. Wilhelm Worringer defines Gothic art in terms of a geometrical line that is "primi tive" but has taken on life. But this vitality is not organic, as it will be in the classical world: this line "embodies no organic expression.. . it is nevertheless of the utmost vitality... .Since this line is lacking in all organic timbre, its expression of life must, as an expression, be divorced from organic life.. . The pathos of movement which lies in this vitalized geometry—a pre lude to the vitalized mathematics of Gothic architecture—forces our sensibility to an effort unnatural to it." *Form in Gothic *(London: Putnam's and Sons, 1927), pp. 41-42. 96. This is one of the essential points of V. Gordon Childe's argument in *The Prehistory * *of European Civilization *(London: Cassell, 1962): the metallurgist is the first specialized arti san, whose sustenance is made possible by the formation of an agricultural surplus. The rela tion of the smith to agriculture has to do not only with the tools smiths manufacture but also with the food they take or receive. The Dogon myth, as analyzed in its variants by Griaule, can be seen as marking this relation, in which the smith receives or steals grains, and hides them in his mallet. 97. Maurice Lombard, *Lesm'etauxdansI'ancien mondedu VeauXIesiecle(The*Hague: Mouton, 1974), pp. 75, 255. 98. The social position of the smith has been the object of detailed studies; for Africa in particular see the classic study by W. B. Cline, "Mining and Metallurgy in Negro Africa," *Gen-  eral Series in Anthropology, *no. 5 (1937); and Pierre Clement, "Le forgeron en Afrique noire,"  *Revue de geographie humaine et d'ethnologie, *no. 2 (April-June 1948), pp. 35-58. But these studies are hardly conclusive; the better defined the principles invoked—"reaction of con tempt," "of approbation," "of apprehension"—the hazier and more overlapping the results, as seen in Clement's tables. 99. See Jules Bloch, *Les Tziganes, *Que sais-je?, no. 580 (Paris: PUF, 1969). Bloch dem onstrates precisely that the distinction between sedentaries and nomads becomes secondary in connection with cave dwelling.

Maurice Griaule and Germaine Dieterlen, *Le renard pale, *vol. 1 (Paris: Institut d'ethnologie, 1965), p. 376. 103. The book by Robert James Forbes, *Metallurgy in Antiquity *(Leiden: Brill, 1950), analyzes the different ages of metallurgy, as well as the types of metallurgists that existed in the "ore stage": the "miner," who did the prospecting and mining; the "smelter" [who produced the crude metal or alloy]; the "blacksmith" [who manufactured mass products from crude metals]; and the "metalworker" [who produced smaller objects; includes goldand silver smiths] (pp. 74-76). The specialization system becomes more complicated in the Iron Age, with attendant variations in the nomad-itinerant-sedentary distribution. 104. The texts of T. E. Lawrence, *Seven Pillars of Wisdom *(New York: Doubleday, Doran, 1935) and "The Science of Guerrilla War," in *Encyclopedia Britannica, *14th ed. (1929), vol. 10, pp. 950-953, remain among the most significant works on guerrilla warfare; they present themselves as an "anti-Foch" theory and elaborate the notion of the nonbattle. But the nonbattle has a history that is not entirely dependent on guerrilla warfare: (1) the traditional distinction between the "battle" and the "maneuver" in war; see Raymon Aron,  *Penser la guerre. Clausewitz *(Paris: Gallimard, 1976), vol. 1, pp. 122-131; (2) the way in which the war of movement places the role and importance of the battle in question (as early as Marshal de Saxe, and the controversial question of the battle during the Napoleonic Wars); (3) finally, more recently, the critique of the battle in the name of nuclear arms, which play a deterrent role, with conventional forces now having a role only in "testing" or "man euver"; see the Gaullist conception of the nonbattle, and Guy Brossollet, *Essai sur la  non-bataille *(Paris: Belin, 1975). The recent return to the notion of the battle cannot be explained simply by technological factors such as the development of tactical nuclear arms, but implies political considerations—it is upon these that the role assigned to the battle (or nonbattle) in war depends. 105. On the fundamental differences between Tamerlane and Genghis Khan, see Rene Grousset, *The Empire of the Steppes, *trans.

Nicolet, and H. van Effenterre (Paris: CNRS, 1977); this colloquium best covers the fiscal aspect but deals with the other two as well. The question of the distribution of land to soldiers and the families of soldiers comes up in every State and plays an essential role. In one particular form, it lay the foundation for fiefs and feudalism. But it already lay at the basis of "false fiefs" around the world, most notably of the *clews *and cleruchy in Greek civilization.

Erich Ludendorff, *Der totale Krieg *(Munich: Ludendorff Verlag, 1935), notes that the evolution has been toward attributing more and more importance to the "people" and "domestic policies" in war, whereas Clausewitz still puts the emphasis on armies and foreign policy. This criticism is true overall, despite certain texts of Clausewitz. The same criticism is also made by Lenin and the Marxists (although they obviously have a totally different concep tion of the people and domestic policy than Ludendorff).

As John Ulric Nef shows, it was during the great period of "limited war" (1640-1740) that the phenomena of concentration, accumulation, and investment emerged—the same  phenomena that were later to determine "total war." See *War and Human Progress *(New  York: Norton, 1968). The Napoleonic code of war represents a turning point that brought  together the elements of total war: mobilization, transport, investment, information, etc. 110. On this "transcending" of fascism, and of total war, and on the new point of inversion of Clausewitz's formula, see Virilio's entire analysis in *L'insecurit'e du terhtoire, *especially  chapter 1. 111. Guy Brossollet, *Essai sur la non-bataille, *pp. 15-16. The axiomatic notion of the "unspecified enemy" is already well developed in official and unofficial texts on national  defense, on international law, and in the judicial or police spheres. 13\. 7000 B.C.: Apparatus of Capture 1. The principal book in this respect is *Mitra-Varuna *(Paris: Gallimard, 1948) (it also contains the analysis of the "One-Eyed" and the "One-Armed" gods). 2. The theme of the Binder-God and the magic knot has been the object of general stud ies in mythology, notably Mircea Eliade, *Images and Symbols, *trans. Philip Mairet (Kansas  City: Sheed, Andrews, and McMeel, 1961), chapter 3. But these studies are ambiguous  because they use a syncretic and archetypal method. Dumezil's method, on the other hand, is  differential: the theme of capture or of the bond only groups various data together under a dif-  ferential trait, which is constituted precisely by political sovereignty. On the opposition  between these two methods, one can refer to Edmond Ortigues, *Le discours et le symbole  *(Paris: Aubier, 1962). 3. Dumezil, *Mitra- Varuna, *pp. 113-114, 151, 202-203.   4.

Even the military democracy Morgan described does not  explain, but presupposes, an archaic State of the imperial type (the work of Detienne and  Vernant establishes this). This imperial State itself functions first with jailers and police, and  not warriors: see Dumezil, *Mitra- Varuna, *pp. 200-204. 9. The idea itself of an Asiatic despotic formation appeared in the eighteenth century, notably in Montesquieu, but was used to describe an evolved state of the empires and corre-  sponded to absolute monarchy. Entirely different is the viewpoint of Marx, who recreates the  notion in order to define the archaic empires. The principal texts in this regard are Marx,

Sociales, 1969). 10. Varron made a famous pun on *nexum *and *nee suumfit *( = the thing does not become the property of he who receives it). In effect, the *nexum *is a fundamental form of archaic Roman law, according to which it is not an accord between contracting parties that creates an obligation, but the borrower's or donor's word, in a magico-religious mode. This is not a con tract *(mancipatio), *and it involves no buying-selling, even deferred, and no interest, although it seems to us that it may involve a kind of rent. See in particular Pierre Noailles, *Fas et Jus * (Paris: Les Belles Lettres, 1948); and Dumezil, who stresses the connection between the  *nexum *and the magic bond, *Mitra-Varuna, *pp. 118-124. 11. See the excavations and studies of James Mellaart, *Earliest Civilizations in the Near * *East *(New York: McGraw-Hill, 1965) and *Catal HuyukQievj *York: McGraw-Hill, 1967). The urbanist Jane Jacobs has drawn on this work in proposing an imperial model she calls "New Obsidian" (after the name of the lava used to make tools), which may go back to the beginning of Neolithic times, or even much further into the past. She stresses the "urban" origin of agri culture and the role of hybridizations occurring in the urban grain stocks: It is agriculture that presupposes the stock, and not the reverse. In an as yet unpublished study, Jean Robert ana lyzes Mellaart's theses and Jacobs's hypothesis, applying them to new perspectives  *(D'ecoloniser Vespace).* 12. Clastres, *Society against the State, *trans. Robert Hurley (New York: Urizen, 1977). We have seen that, according to Clastres, primitive war is one of the principal mechanisms warding off the State in that it maintains the opposition and dispersion of small segmentary groups. But also, from this viewpoint, primitive war remains subordinated to these preven tive mechanisms and does not become autonomous as a machine, even when it comprises a specialized body. 13. According to Griaznov, it was the sedentary farmers who went out on the steppe and became nomadic, during the Bronze Age: This is a case of a zigzag movement in evolution. See  *The Ancient Civilization of Southern Siberia, *trans. James Hogarth (New York: Cowles, 1969), pp. 97-98, 131-133. 14. Jean Robert develops this notion of an "inversion of signs and messages": "In a first phase, information circulates principally from the periphery toward the center, but at a cer tain critical point, the town begins to emit, in the direction of the rural world, increasingly imperative messages"; the town becomes an exporter *(D'ecoloniser I'espace).* 15. On Chinese towns and their subordination to the imperial principle, see Etienne Balazs, *Chinese Civilization and Bureaucracy, *trans. H. M. Wright (New Haven, Conn.: Yale University Press, 1964), p. 410: "The social structures in both India and China automatically rejected the town and offered, as it were, refractory, substandard material to it. It was because society was well and truly frozen in a sort of irreducible system, a previous crystallization." 16. From all of these standpoints, Francois Chatelet questions the classical notion of the city-state and doubts that the Athenian city can be equated with any variety of State: "La Grece classique, la Raison, I'Etat," in Alberto Asor Rosa et al., *En marge. L'Occident et ses  "autres", *(Paris: Aubier Montaigne, 1978). Islam was to confront analogous problems, as would Italy, Germany, and Flanders beginning in the eleventh century; in these cases, politi cal power does not imply the State-form. An example is the community of Hanseatic towns, which lacked functionaries, an army, and even legal status. The town is always inside a net work of towns, but, precisely, "the network of towns" does not coincide with "mosaic of

(On town-State relations in the West, see pp. 396-406.) And as Braudel notes, one of the reasons for the victory of the States over the towns from the beginning of the fifteenth century was that the State alone had the ability fully to appropriate the war machine: by means of the territorial recruit ment of men, material investment, the industrialization of war (it was more in the arms facto ries than in the pin factories that mass production and mechanical division appeared). The commercial towns, on the other hand, required wars of short duration, resorted to mercenar ies, and were only able to encast the war machine. 20. This theme is frequently developed by Samir Amin: "Since the theory of relations between different social formations cannot be an economistic one, international relations, which belong precisely to this context, cannot give rise to an economic theory." *Unequal  Development, *trans.

Samir Amin analyzes this particularity of the "peripheral formations" of the Third World and distinguishes two principal types, the oriental and African, and the American: "The Americas, Asia and the Arab world, and Black Africa were not transformed in the same way because they were not integrated at the same stage of capitalist development at the center and therefore did not fulfill the same function in development." *Unequal Development, p. * 295\. See also *Accumulation on a Worldscale, *vol. 2, trans. Brian Pearce (New York: Monthly Review Press, 1974), pp. 390-394. We shall see, however, that under certain conditions the center and the periphery are determined in such a way as to exchange their characteristics. 24. Gaetan Pirou, *Economie liberale et economie dirigee, *vol. 1 (Paris: Ed. Sedes, 1946-1947), p. 117: "The productivity of the marginal worker determines not only that worker's wage but that of all the others, in the same way that, when it was a question of commodities, the utility of the last bucket of water or last sack of wheat governed the value not only of that bucket or that sack but of all the other buckets and all the other sacks." (Marginalism seeks to quantify the assemblage, when in fact all kinds of qualitative factors are at work in the evaluation of the "last.") 25. On the importance of the theory of evaluation and feeling out for marginalism, see Jacques Fradin's critical discussion, *Les fondements logiques de la th'eorie neoclassique de  I'echange *(Grenoble: Presses Universitaires de Grenoble, 1976). For Marxists, there is also a groping evaluation, but one that can bear only on the quantity of socially necessary labor; Engels speaks of this precisely in the context of precapitalist societies. He invokes "a process of zig-zag approximation, often groping back and forth in the dark," which is governed more or less by the "need for each person to have a rough idea of his costs" (one may wonder if this last part of the phrase does not reinstate a sort of marginalist criterion).

Bousquet and G. Busino  (Geneva: Librairie Droz, 1964), pp. 2-16. The first portion of this discussion is translated in  Vilfredo Pareto, *Sociological Writings, *ed. and intro. S. E. Fine, trans. Derick Mirtin (New  York: Praeger, 1966), pp. 97-102.] 27. David Ricardo, *On the Principles of Political Economy, *in *The Works and Correspon-* *dence of David Ricardo, *vol. 1, ed. Piero Sraffa (London: Cambridge University Press,  1962), chapter 2. See also Marx's analysis of the two forms of "differential rent," *Capital,  *vol. 3, part 6. 28. Of course, the least fertile land is also in theory the most recent or the last in a series (which allows many commentators to say that Ricardo prefigured marginalism in his theory  of rent). But this is not even a rule, and Marx shows that an "increasing sequence" is just as  possible as a "decreasing sequence" and that a better soil can "take the lowest place instead of  that which was formerly the worst." *Capital, *vol. 3, p. 798. 29. [ TRANS : *Capital, *vol. 3, p. 788.] 30. Ricardo, *On the Principles of Political Economy, *p. 75: "If air, water, the elasticity of steam, and the pressure of the atmosphere, were of different qualities; if they could be appro-  priated, and each quality existed only in moderate abundance, they, as well as the land, would  afford a rent, as the successive qualities were brought into use." 31. The two forms of *differential rent *are based on comparison. But Marx maintains the existence of another form, unknown to the theorists (Ricardo), but with which the practition-  ers, he says, are quite familiar: *absolute rent, *based on the special character of landed property  as monopoly. In effect, land is not a commodity like the others because it is not reproducible at  the level of a determinable aggregate. There is therefore monopoly, which is not the same as  "monopoly price" (monopoly price, and the eventual corresponding rent, are totally different  questions). In the simplest terms, differential rent and absolute rent can be distinguished in  the following manner: since the price of the product is calculated on the basis of the worst soil,  the entrepreneur with the best soil would have a surplus profit if the latter were not trans-  formed into differential rent accruing to the landowner; but on the other hand, since agricul-  tural surplus value is proportionally greater than industrial surplus value (?), the agricultural  entrepreneur in general would have a surplus profit if the latter were not transformed into  absolute rent accruing to the landowner. Rent is thus a necessary element in the equalization  and adjustment of profit: whether it be the equalization of the agricultural profit rate (differ-  ential rent), or the equalization of this rate and the rate of industrial profit (absolute rent).  Certain Marxist economists have proposed an entirely different schema of absolute rent, but  one that maintains Marx's necessary distinction, [ TRANS : On absolute rent, see Marx, *Capital, * vol. 3, part 6, chapter 45, pp. 895-899.] 32. Bernard Schmitt, *Monnaie, salaires et profit *(Paris: Castella, 1980), pp. 289-290, distinguishes between two forms of capture or "harnessing," which correspond moreover to  the two principal figures of the hunt, *waiting *and *pursuit. *Rent would be a residual or  waiting kind of capture because it depends on external forces and operates by transfer;  profit would be a capture of pursuit or conquest because it derives from a specific action and  requires a force of its own or a "creation." This holds true, however, only in relation to differ-  ential rent; as Marx noted, absolute rent represents the "creative" aspect of landed property  *(Capital, *vol. 3, p. 889). 33. Edouard Will, *Korinthiaka *(Paris: Ed. De Boccard, 1955), pp. 470ff, analyzes a late, but exemplary, case, that of the tyrant Cypselos's reform in Corinth: (1) a portion of the land  belonging to the hereditary aristocracy was confiscated and distributed to the poor peasants;  (2) but at the same time a metallic stock was constituted, through seizure of the property of  proscribed persons; (3) this money itself was distributed to the poor, but in order for them to

568 □ NOTES TO PP. 443-449 give it to the old owners as an indemnity; (4) the old owners from then on paid their taxes in money, so as to ensure a circulation or turnover of the currency, and an equivalence between money, goods, and services. We already find analogous figures directly inscribed in the archaic empires, independently of the problems of private property. For example, land is dis tributed to the functionaries in their capacity as functionaries, and they exploit or lease it. But if the functionary thereby receives a rent in labor or in kind from it, he owes the emperor a tax payable in money. Hence the necessity of "banks," which, under complex conditions, ensure the equivalence, conversion, and circulation of goods-money throughout the economy; see Guillaume Cardascia, "Armee et fiscalite dans la Babylone achemenide," in *Armees et  fiscalit'e dans le monde antique *(Paris: CNRS, 1977). 34. [ TRANS : On these three forms of rent, see Marx, *Capital, *vol. 3, part 6, chapter 47, pp. 925-938.] 35. Authors like Will and Gabriel Ardant have demonstrated that the commercial func tion does not account for the origin of money, tied to ideas of "payment," "settlement," "tax ation." Will proves this in particular for the Greek and Western worlds; but even in the oriental empires, we think that the monopoly over monetarized trade assumes monetary taxation. See Edouard Will, "Reflexions et hypotheses sur les origines du monnayage,"  *Revue numismatique, *vol. 17 (1955), pp. 3-24; Gabriel Ardant, *Histoire financiere de  I'antiquite a nos jours *(Paris: Gallimard, 1976), pp. 28ff.: "The milieus that gave rise to taxa tion also gave rise to money." 36. On this aspect of indirect taxation, see Arghiri Emmanuel, *Unequal Exchange, *trans. Brian Pearce (New York: Monthly Review Press, 1972), pp. 1-2, 228-236 (in relation to for eign trade). Concerning the relations taxation-trade, a particularly interesting case is that of mercantilism, analyzed by Eric Alliez *(Capital et pouvoir, *unpublished manuscript). 37. [ TRANS : Marx presents his trinity formula (capital-profit, land-ground rent, labor-wages) in *Capital, *vol. 3, chapter 48.] 38. Bernard Schmitt, *Monnaie, salaires et profits.* 39. Marx often emphasizes the following points, particularly in his analysis of primitive accumulation: (1) Primitive accumulation precedes the mode of production and makes it pos sible. (2) It therefore implies specific action by the State and the law, which are not opposed to violence but, on the contrary, promote it ("These methods depend in part on brute force.... But they all employ the power of the state, the concentrated and organized force of society."  *Capital, *vol. 1, trans. Ben Fowkes [New York: Vintage, 1977], chapter 31, p. 915). (3) This lawful violence appears first in its raw form but ceases to be conscious to the degree that the mode of production becomes established; it seems to be a fact of nature pure and simple ("direct extra-economic force is still of course used, but only in exceptional cases"; ibid., p. 899). (4) A movement such as this is explained by the particular character of this violence, which is in no case reducible to theft, crime, or illegality (see *Notes surAdolph Wagner *in  *Oeu-vres de Karl Marx, *"Pleiade" edition, vol. 2, ed. Maximilien Rubel [Paris: Gallimard, 1968]): what is taken away from the worker is not something surface level; the capitalist "does not limit himself to taking away or stealing, but extorts the production of a surplus value, *in other words, *he first contributes to the creation of that from which he takes away.... A part of the value created without the labor of the capitalist can be appropriated legally by the capitalist, in other words, without violating the corresponding right to the exchange of commodities." 40. Jean Robert thoroughly demonstrates, in this context, that primitive accumulation implies the violent construction of a homogenized, "colonized" space ("Decoloniser l'espace," unpublished manuscript). 41.

He demonstrates that Roman law is a "law without concepts" that proceeds by  "topics," and in this sense differs from the modern, "axiomatic" conception of the law.

In his analysis of the primitive accumulation of  capital, Maurice Dobb *(Studies in the Development of Capitalism, *rev. ed. [New York: Inter-  national Publishers, 1964], pp. 177-186) effectively demonstrates that primitive accumula-  tion bears not on the means of production but on "rights or titles to wealth" (p. 177; modified  to agree with the French translation cited by the authors), which, depending on the circum-  stances, are convertible into means of production. 50. See the distinction certain jurists make between Roman, "topical," law, and modern, "axiomatic," law of the civil-code type. We may define certain fundamental ways in which the  French Civil Code is closer to an axiomatic than to a code: (1) the predominance of the  enunciative form over the imperative and over affective formulas (damnation, exhortation,  admonishment, etc.); (2) the code's pretension that it forms a complete and saturated rational  system; (3) but at the same time the relative independence of the propositions, which permit  axioms to be added. On these aspects, see Jean Ray, *Essai sur la structure logique du code civil  francais *(Paris: Alcan, 1926). It has been established that the systematization of Roman law  took place very late, in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. 51.

570 □ NOTES TO PP. 453-463 of the best analysts of the monetary system, as well as of "private-public" mixes in the modern economy. 53. On the tendency toward the elimination of ground rent in capitalism, see Samir Amin and Kostas Vergopoulos, *La questionpaysanne et le capitalisme *(Paris: Ed. Anthropos, 1974). Amin analyzes the reasons why ground rent and rent of mines keep or assume a present-day meaning in the peripheral regions, although in different ways; *The Law of Value and Historical  Materialism, *trans. Brian Pearce (New York: Monthly Review Press, 1978), chapters 4 and 6. 54. Introductory books on the axiomatic method emphasize a certain number of prob lems. For example, Robert Blanche's fine book, *L'axiomatique *(Paris: PUF, 1959) [abridged and translated by G. B. *Keene as Axiomatics (New York: *Free Press of Glencoe, 1962)]. There is first of all the question of the respective independence of the axioms, and whether or not the system is saturated, or "strongly complete" (sec. 14 and 15). Second, there is the question of "models of realization," their heterogeneity, but also their isomorphy in relation to the axio matic system (sec. 12). Then there is the possibility of a polymorphy of models, not only in a nonsaturated system, but even in a saturated axiomatic (sec. 12, 15, and 26). Then, once again, there is the question of the "undecidable propositions" an axiomatic confronts (sec. 20). Finally, there is the question of "power," by which nondemonstrable infinite sets exceed the axiomatic (sec. 26 and "the power of the continuum"). The comparison of politics to an axiomatic is based on all of these aspects. 55. Lewis Mumford, "The First Megamachine," Diogenes, no. 55 (July-September 1966), p. 3. [translation modified to agree with the French translation cited by the authors]. 56. Ergonomics distinguishes between "human-machine" systems (or work posts) and "humans-machines" systems (communicational aggregates composed of human and nonhuman elements). But this is not only a difference of degree; the second point of view is not a generalization of the first: "The notion of information loses its anthropocentric aspect," and the problems are not of adaptation but of the choice of a human or nonhuman element depending on the case. See Maurice de Montmollin, *Les systemes hommesmachines *(Paris: PUF, 1967). The issue is no longer to adapt, even under violence, but to localize: Where is your place? Even handicaps can be made useful, instead of being corrected or compensated for. A deaf-mute can be an essential part of a "humans-machines" communicational system. 57. One of the basic themes of science fiction is to show how machinic enslavement com bines with processes of subjection, but exceeds and differs from them, performing a qualita tive leap. Take Ray Bradbury: television not as an instrument located at the center of the house, but as forming the walls of the house. 58. See Lewis Mumford, *The Pentagon ojPower, *vol. 2 of*The Myth ojthe Machine*(New York: Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, 1970), pp. 236-360 (a comparison of the "old megama-chine" and the modern one; despite writing, the old megamachine notably suffered from difficulties in "communication"). 59. Marx, *Manuscripts of 1844, *p. 129. 60. Historically, these have been the major problems in axiomatics: "undecidable" prop ositions (contradictory statements are also nondemonstrable); the powers of infinite sets, which by nature elude axiomatic treatment ("the continuum, for example, cannot be con ceived axiomatically in its structural specificity since every axiomatization one can give it will rely on a denumerable model"). See Blanche, *L'axiomatique, *p. 80. 61. The "intuitionist" school (Brouwer, Heytig, Griss, Bouligand, etc.) is of great impor tance in mathematics, not because it asserted the irreducible rights of intuition, or even because it elaborated a very novel constructivism, but because it developed a conception of  *problems, *and of a *calculus of problems *that intrinsically rivals axiomatics and proceeds by other rules (notably with regard to the excluded middle). 62. In our opinion, one of the best analyses of the Nazi economy is Jean-Pierre Faye's

0 NOTES TO PP. 463-472 □ 571 *Langages totalitaires *(Paris: Hermann, 1972), pp. 664-676. Faye shows that Nazism is indeed a totalitarianism, precisely because of its minimal State, its refusal of any statification of the economy, its reduction of wages, its hostility toward large-scale public works. But at the same time, he shows that Nazism carries out the creation of domestic capital, strategic construc tion, and the building of an arms industry, which makes it rival or sometimes even meld with an economy of socialist leaning ("something that seems *to *resemble the Swedish loans praised by Myrdal with a view to large-scale projects, but which is in fact and immediately its oppo site, the writing of an arms economy and a war economy," and the corresponding difference between "the public works entrepreneur" and the "army supplier"; pp. 668, 674). 63. See the critical list of the axioms of the periphery presented by Samir Amin, *Accumu-* *lation on a Worldscale, *pp. 390-394. 64.

Mark Polizzotti (New York: Semiotext[e], 1986); *Defense populaire et luttes ecologiques * (Paris: Galilee, 1978), forthcoming in English translation from Semiotext(e) as *Popular  Defense and Ecological Struggles: *it is precisely beyond fascism and total war that the war machine finds its complete object, in the menacing peace of nuclear deterrence. It is there that the reversal of Clausewitz's formula takes on a concrete meaning, at the same time as State politics tends to wither and the war machine takes over a maximum of civil functions ("place the whole of civil society under the regime of military security," "disqualify the whole of the planet's habitat by stripping the peoples of their quality of inhabitant," "erase the distinction between wartime and peacetime"; see the role of the media in this respect). Certain European police forces could be taken as an example, when they claim the right to "shoot on sight": they cease to be a cogwheel in the State apparatus and become pieces in a war machine. 65. Braudel shows how this center of gravity formed in northern Europe, but at the out come of movements that, starting in the ninth and tenth centuries, put the European spaces of the North and the South in competition or rivalry with one another (this problem is not to be confused with that of the town-form and State-form, but does intersect with it). See "Naissance d'une economie-monde," *Urbi, *no. 1 (September 1979), pp. 3-20. 66. A movement in Marxist research formed on the basis of the work of Mario Tronti *(Operai e capitate *[Turin: G. Einaudi, 1971]; French translation, *Ouvriers et capital *[Paris: Bourgois, 1977]), then that of Italian autonomy and Antonio Negri, whose aim was to analyze the new forms of work and the struggle against work. It was a question of showing simultane ously: (1) that the struggle against work is not an accidental or "marginal" phenomenon in capitalism, but one essential to the composition of capital (the growth in the proportion of constant capital), and, (2) that this phenomenon engenders a new type of worldwide struggle—workers' struggles, popular struggles, ethnic struggles—in every domain. See Antonio Negri, especially *Marx Beyond Marx: Lessons on the Grundrisse, *ed. Jim Fleming, trans. Harry Cleaver, Michael Ryan, and Maurizion Viano (South Hadley, Mass.: Bergin and Garvey, 1984); Karl Heinz Roth, *Die "andere" Arbeiterbewegung *(Munich: Trikont, 1974); and the current work in France of Yann Moulier, Alain and Daniele Guillerm, Benjamin Coriat, etc. [ TRANS : The best sources on the autonomy movement in English are *Italy: * *Autonomia.

This is one of the essential theses of Tronti, who defined the new conceptions of the "mass-worker" and of the relation to work: "To struggle against capital, the working class must fight against itself insofar as it is capital; this is the maximal stage of contradiction, not forthe workers, but for the capitalists ** The plan of capital begins to run backward, not as a *social*

This is another aspect of the present-day situation: in addition to the new struggles tied to work and the evolution in work, there is the entire domain of what are called "alterna-  tive practices" and the construction of such practices (pirate radio stations would be the  simplest example; other examples are urban community networks, the alternative to psychia-  try, etc.).

On Riemann's and Helmholtz's presentations of multiplicity, see Jules Vuillemin, *Philosophie de I'algebre *(Paris: PUF, 1962), pp. 409ff. 15. See Bertrand Russell, *The Principles ofMathematics *(New York: Norton, 1964), chapter 31\. The following discussion does not conform to Russell's theory. An excellent analysis of the notions of distance and magnitude according to Meinong and Russell may be found in Albert Spaier, *La pensee et la quantite *(Paris: Alcan, 1927). 16. Beginning in chapter 2 of *Time and Free Will: An Essay on the Immediate Data of * *Consciousness, *trans.F. L. Pogson (New York: Macmillan, 1958), Bergson repeatedly uses the noun "multiplicity," under conditions that should attract the attention of commentators; that there is an implicit reference to Riemann seems beyond doubt. Later, in *Matter and Memory, * trans. Nancy Margaret Paul and W. Scott Palmer (New York: Humanities Press, 1978), he explains that Achilles' stride can be divided perfectly into "submultiples" that differ in nature, however, from that which they divide; the same goes for the tortoise's stride; and the submultiples, "in both cases," themselves differ in nature. 17. See Bergson, *Time and Free Will, *p. 82: if a multiplicity "implies the possibility of treating any number whatever as a provisional unit which can be added to itself, inversely the units in their turn are true numbers which are as big as we like, but are regarded as provision ally indivisible for the purpose of compounding them with one another." 18.

Serres, *La naissance de la physique, *pp. 35, 135ff. 24. Anne Querrien has clearly demonstrated the importance of the Ecole des Ponts et Chaussees (School of Bridges and Roadways) in this elaboration of the concept of work. For example, Navier, an engineer and professor of mechanics, wrote in 1819: "We must establish a mechanical currency with which to estimate the quantities of work used to accomplish every kind of fabrication." 25. It is a commonplace of missionaries' narratives that there is nothing corresponding to the category of work, even in transhumant agriculture, with its laborious ground-clearing activities. Marshall Sahlins is not content to remark the briefness of the time devoted to the labor necessary for maintenance and reproduction, but goes on to stress qualitative factors: the continuous variation that regulates activity, and the mobility or freeness of movement, which excludes stockpiling and is measured in terms of the "convenience of transporting the object."

0 574 D NOTES TO PP. 493-498 "monads" (as opposed to the unitary Subject of Euclidean space): see Gilles Chatelet, "Sur une petite phrase de Riemann," *Analytiques, *no. 3 (May 1979). Although the "monads" are no longer thought to be closed upon themselves, and are postulated to entertain direct, step-by-step local relations, the purely monadological point of view proves inadequate and should be superseded by a "nomadology" (the ideality of striated space versus the realism of smooth space). 28. See Edmund Carpenter's description in *Eskimo *of ice space, and of the igloo: "There is no middle distance, no perpecti ve, no outline, nothing the eye can cling to except thousands of smokey plumes of snow... a land without bottom or edge ... a labyrinth alive with the movements of crowded people. No flat static walls arrest the ear or eye ... and the eye can glance through here, past there" (no pagination). 29. These two aspects, the Encompassing Element and the Center, figure in Jean-Pierre Vernant's analysis of space in Anaximander; *Mythe et penseee chez les Grecs *(Paris: Maspero, 1971-1974), vol. 1, part 3. From another perspective, the entire history of the desert concerns the possibility of its becoming the encompassing element, and also of being repelled, rejected by the center, as though in an inversion of movement. In a phenomenology of religion like that of Van der Leeuw, the *nomos *itself does indeed appear as the encompassinglimit or ground, and also as that which is repelled, excluded, in a centrifugal movement. 30. Whatever interactions there may be, the "art of the steppes" had a specificity that was communicated to the migrating Germans; in spite of his many reservations about nomad cul ture, Rene Grousset makes this point in *The Empire of the Steppes, *trans. Naomi Walford (New Brunswick, N. J.: Rutgers University Press, 1970). pp. 11 -25. He notes the irreducibility of Scythian art to Assyrian art, Sarmatian art to Persian art, and Hunnic art to Chinese art. He even points out that the art of the steppes influenced more than it borrowed (see in particular the question of Ordos art and its relations to China). 31. On this question of light and color, in particular in Byzantine art, see Henri Maldiney, *Regard, parole, espace, *pp. 203ff., 239ff. 32. The correlation, "haptic-close-abstract," was already suggested by Riegl. But it was Worringer who developed the theme of the abstract line. Although he conceives of it essentially in its Egyptian form, he describes a second form in which the abstract assumes an intense life and an expressionist value, all the while remaining inorganic: *Abstraction  and Empathy, *chapter 5, and especially *Form in Gothic *(London: Putnam's and Sons, 1927), pp. 38-55. 33. Andre Leroi-Gourhan, *Legesteet la parole *(Paris: Albin Michel, 1964-1965), vol. 1, *Technique et langage, *pp. 263ff.; vol. 2, *La m'emoire et les rythmes, *pp. 219ff. ("Rhythmic marks are anterior to explicit figures.") Worringer's position is very ambiguous; thinking that prehistoric art is fundamentally figurative, he excludes it from Art, on the same grounds as he excludes the "scribblings of a child" *(Abstraction and Empathy, *pp. 51-55). Then he advances the hypothesis that the cave dwellers were the "ultimate result" of a series he says began with the abstract (p. 130). But would not such a hypothesis force Worringer to revise his conception of the abstract, and to cease identifying it with Egyptian geometricism? 34. Worringer establishes an opposition between the power of repetition, which is mechanical, multiplying, and without fixed orientation, and the force of symmetry, which is organic, additive, oriented, and centered. He sees this as the fundamental difference between Gothic ornamentation and Greek or classical ornamentation: *Form in Gothic, *pp. 53-55 ("The Ceaseless Melody of the Northern Line"). In a fine book, *Esthetiques d'Orient et  d'Occident *(Paris: E. Leroux, 1937), Laura Morgenstern develops a particular example, dis tinguishing the "symmetrical antithetism" of Sassanid Persian art from the "disjointed antithetism" of the art of the prdto-Iranian nomads (Sarmatians). Many authors, however, have stressed the centered and symmetrical motifs in barbarian or nomad art. Worringer

NOTES TO PP. 498-499 □ 575 anticipated this objection: "Instead of the regular and invariably geometrical star or rosette or similar restful forms, in the North we find the revolving wheel, the turbine or the so-called sun wheel, all designs which express violent movement. Moreover, the movement is peripheral and not radial" *(Form in Gothic, *p. 54). The history of technology confirms the importance of the turbine in the life of the nomads. In another, bio-aesthetic, context, Gabriel Tarde opposes repetition as indefinite potential *(puissance) *to symmetry as limitation. With symmetry, life constituted an organism for itself, taking a star-shaped or reflected, infolded form (the radiata and mollusks). It is true that in doing so it unleashed another type of repetition, external reproduction; see *L 'opposition universale *(Paris: Alcan, 1897). 35. [ TRANS : Worringer, *Abstraction and Empathy, *p. 33] 36. [ TRANS : Worringer, *Abstraction and Empathy, *p. 42] 37. On all of these points, see Georges Charriere's very intuitive book, *Scythian Art *(New York: Alpine Fine Arts Collection, 1979), which includes a great number of reproductions. It is doubtless Rene Grousset who has most effectively emphasized "slowness" as a dramatic pole of nomad art: *The Empire of the Steppes, *pp. 13-14. 38. Dora Vallier, in her preface to the French translation of *Abstraction and Empathy * *(Abstraction et Einfuhlung *[Paris: Klincksieck, 1978]), is right to note Worringer and Kandinsky's independence from one another, and the differences between the problems they were addressing. However, she maintains that there is still convergence and resonance between them. In a sense, all art is abstract, with the figurative springing from certain types of abstraction. But in another sense, since there are very different types of lines (Egyptian-geometrical, Greek-organic, Gothic-vital, etc.), the question then becomes one of determining which line remains abstract, or realizes abstraction as such. It is doubtful that it is the geometrical line, since it still draws a figure, even though an abstract and nonrepresentative one. Rather, the abstract line is that defined by Michael Fried in relation to certain works by Pollock: multidirectional, with neither inside nor outside, form nor background, delimiting nothing, describing no contour, passing between spots or points, filling a smooth space, stirring up a close-lying haptic visual matter that "both invites the act of seeing on the part of the spectator yet gives his eye nowhere to rest once and for all," *(Three  American Painters *[Cambridge, Mass.: Fogg Art Museum, 1965], p. 14). In Kandinsky himself, abstraction is realized not so much by geometrical structures as by lines of march or transit that seem to recall Mongolian nomadic motifs.
